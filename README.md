I migrated from Wordpress to Hugo, and now am fully JAMstack'd and happy.

## Dependencies

I'm supplementing Hugo's pipes with a little postcss action. You'll need the following to build:

```
npm i -g postcss-cli autoprefixer @fullhuman/postcss-purgecss
npm i -D postcss-cli autoprefixer @fullhuman/postcss-purgecss
```
