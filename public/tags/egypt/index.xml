From there we will hop in a 4×4 with a Bedouin man who will guide us further. I’m part of a small party consisting of a German by way of Lebanon, a Canadian by way of Jordan, and an Iranian (-American) by way of Israel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bus is massive but largely empty. The seats are comfortable and recline. Both were unexpected, but super appreciated. There’s one mosquito flying around that no one seems to be able to kill. We just hit a parked car while backing out of our spot, but of course we did. We’re heading out on a six-hour journey to the middle of the Sahara.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the bus slows in the first town, reacting to traffic, a small boy hops on and starts dropping rolls of mints in everybody’s laps as he walks down the aisle. Then he returns to the front and tells each person, “Pay me,” in Arabic. That’s one way to sell a mint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wake up several hours in at a building that I have a hard time believing exists. It’s a small, but bustling restaurant, miles away from any civilization with nothing but stretcing sands in between. As the bus is refueling, we step inside to grab some water and stretch our legs. The place is full of people, all stopping in the middle of some journey to somewhere, eating and drinking. Outside, the desert crawls to the horizon in all directions.&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I wake up again and we’re near the end of the road. A small town where we’ll meet Abdul, our Bedouin guide, who will be driving us deeper into nowhere. A full day’s worth of travel and the adventure is just getting started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We pile into Abdul’s truck and we’re off. No talking, just driving. We whip through a few small villages and stretches of highway, then enter the Black Desert. There we come up to a building settled on a hill where we will be eating lunch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An Outsider’s Guide to Driving in Egypt</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/driving-in-egypt/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2014 02:47:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/driving-in-egypt/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m writing this from the back seat of cab heading from downtown Cairo to Zamalek.  My driver just smashed a side view mirror off another cab. This isn’t the first time I’ve experienced this. In fact, my record so far in one cab ride is three accidents. But I’m getting ahead of myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The traffic in Cairo is a truly amazing site. It’s either a complete jam, or wide open. I’ve yet to experience anything in between, nor to learn how to anticipate which it will be. I’m already 20 minutes late for a lunch meeting (sorry, Farida!), but I’ve been assured that by “Egyptian time” standards I’m quite alright. I initially thought the lack of promptness here was an artifact of the generally laid-back culture, now I see it as more of a psychological survival tactic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traffic. Is. Chaos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last night I was told that fatalities by car here are in the top per capita worldwide (Number one! Number one! Number one!). I haven’t fact-checked this, nor do I plan on it, but I have little doubt in my mind that it is true. Here are a few reasons why that might be:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Landing in Egypt, Slammed with Culture</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/egypt-culture-shock/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2014 12:16:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/egypt-culture-shock/</guid><description>&lt;p>I arrive in the airport in Cairo at 2am on Thursday. I’ve been traveling since 9am Tuesday. Three hours to Houston, ten or so to Amsterdam, layover for the day there (Pancakes! Walking the canals! Coffee shops!), then a four hour flight to Cairo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Leaving the airport, I get hailed into a cab that I thought was occupied. In the front two seats are the driver, his wife, and two children. In the back seat is a third child. The kids all have paint on their faces, red and black for the boy, red and white for the two little girls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Do you speak English?” I ask. I try in Arabic. “Bititkallim ingileezi?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Yes, yes. Taxi? Get in.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I’m going to Dina’s Hostel. Know it?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Yes, yes, hotel. Get in. Welcome.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then we start driving. We’re flying through what little traffic there is. To the right there is a moped that has three men riding on it. I’m impressed. To the left there’s another moped with three men riding and one is holding a suitcase. Now I’m disappointed in the first moped.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Me + Egypt = June</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/egypt-june/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2014 07:29:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/egypt-june/</guid><description>&lt;p>For the past several years I’ve been social justice comeding.

&lt;p>Well, the time has come.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m the perfect combination of completely excited, completely exhausted, thrilled, depleted, optimistic, and completely-lost-hope-in-humanity-because-of-Buzzfeed for a change of pace. I need a refresher. A break. A time to breathe. A time away from this god-forsaken laptop (kidding, &lt;a href="//macbook-creed/" title="MacBooker’s Creed">I love my laptop&lt;/a>). But I am going to abandon it for a month.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
