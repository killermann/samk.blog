Depicting four vastly different mes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A Me who hates families, Christians, and Christian families. Who is dedicated to “destroying Western Civilization” and will be promptly burning in Hell.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A Me who is saintlike in his love and compassion for others, who is “a glimpse of light in a world that’s gotten dark.” Whose work “literally saved my life.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A Me who is motivated solely by ulterior motives, greed, and who would “best serve the LGBT community by killing yourself.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item></channel></rss>
