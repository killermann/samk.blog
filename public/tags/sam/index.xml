Slightly new direction.</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/totally-new-site-slightly-new-direction/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Mar 2018 04:52:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/totally-new-site-slightly-new-direction/</guid><description>Howdy! Today marks two turning points: the design of this site has changed (from this to this), and the name has changed (from “Dear World” to “Sam Killermann’s Blog”).
From here on, in addition to things I’ve been writing about before (like happiness &amp;amp; technology), I’ll also be writing about how I DIY (do it myself) in all things social good &amp;amp; online platform related, and posting more personal updates about my work/life.</description></item><item><title>My Pre-Trip Insomnia</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/pre-trip-insomnia/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2014 05:22:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/pre-trip-insomnia/</guid><description>I’m flying to Seattle in a couple hours to speak at a conference for teen citizen lobbyists. Social justice advocate teen citizen lobbyists… pretty amazing, right?
As usual, I’m wide awake with no real hope of that changing. It’s been a few years now, and I haven’t outgrown this pre-trip insomnia.</description></item><item><title>Many Lenses Construct Reality</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/lenses-construct-reality/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2014 04:19:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/lenses-construct-reality/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>We don’t live in the same world, you and I. But I’d love for you to try to show me yours, if I try to show you mine.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’re an artist, you see line and shape wherever you look. You take note of the cues that create perspective, and imagine mixing the colors you see. You wonder how the reality you’re looking at might appear in pastels, oil, and acrylic, and how you might recreate that reality later, and how you might alter it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’re a comedian, you see humor between every line. Every word you hear, every thing you see, is passed through an algorithm in your head. [q:] Would that make people laugh on stage? [if no:] What do I need to change/tweak? [if yes:] Write it down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’re a photographer, you see light and the absence of light in everything. You know that everything you’re looking at, and everything you can’t see, is being translated to your eyes through myriad reflections and refractions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcome to Sam Killermann’s Thought / Day</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/welcome/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Oct 2013 19:26:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/welcome/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>I created this because it’s been a long time coming, and I decided to stop letting time slip away.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People have asked again and again if I have a personal blog. I do not. Well, I _did _not. I do now. And I will keep it up for at least one year. 365 days. 12 months. And probably about 500,000 words.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
