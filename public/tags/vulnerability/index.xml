Let’s say I told you:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
&lt;p>
&lt;strong>A. &lt;/strong>I want to remove every unhealthy habit, food, and mindset from my life, and I&amp;#8217;m going to start tomorrow.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;strong>B. &lt;/strong>I&amp;#8217;m going to eat less sugar, starting tomorrow.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>When tomorrow comes, which one are you likely to hold me accountable to? Which might you help me excuse when I fall short? Which are you actually expecting me to do? Or even realistically try?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s do a few more with those questions in mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I say:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
&lt;p>
&lt;strong>A. &lt;/strong>It&amp;#8217;s my goal to transform my country to 100% renewable energy.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;strong>B. &lt;/strong>It&amp;#8217;s my goal to transform my local school district to 50% renewable energy.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Or:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
&lt;p>
&lt;strong>A.&lt;/strong> My organization is going to end racism, globally.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;strong>B.&lt;/strong> My organization is going to help local people of color, and other disenfranchised people, register to vote and get to the polls.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That’s plenty to get the point I’m going to make, I think.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>But first, here’s what I’m not about to say:&lt;/strong> that any of the As above — the lofty, admirable, pie-in-the-sky ambitions — are in any way bad, undesirable, or something I’m advocating against.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want all of those things. I have, at different points in my life, said all of those things, in some way or another. And I don’t even like &lt;a href="https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/insulted-by-ambition/">thinking of myself as ambitious&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Here’s all I want to point out:&lt;/strong> sometime we set the bar so high because it gives us an excuse when we can’t clear it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why I Hadn’t Funded My Work with Patreon</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/why-not-patreon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jan 2019 23:34:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/why-not-patreon/</guid><description>&lt;p>For several years, my “day job” (the one paying my bills) has been performing comedy shows. Meanwhile, my hobby has been creating online resources, tools, and organizations for justice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you think that’s a weird combo, you’re not alone. I’m with you: it’s hard to wrap my mind around the truth that the way I make money is comedy, then I use that money to &lt;em>pay to&lt;/em> do administrative-paperwork-email-non-profit-type stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usually, it’s the other way around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What’s even weirder? Switching things up — and starting to fund my online advocacy work directly, not via comedy shows — seems less likely to succeed than continuing to be a working comedian.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yes — I’ve heard of &lt;a href="https://patreon.com">Patreon&lt;/a>. People have told me about it hundreds of times, for years and years, every time I made that point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of the work I do is a great fit for Patreon. But I’ve been resistant to the idea of funding it that way. The reasons are a mix of ethics and personal discomforts, and are all tied directly to my work, and the change I hope it effects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So why haven’t I done it?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I’m terrified. I’m a professional performer, but in 90 minutes I’ll be sitting down to my first ever singing lesson.</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/singing-lesson-anxiety/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2014 22:12:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/singing-lesson-anxiety/</guid><description>&lt;p>The lesson will be private. One-on-one. And the instructor, Mady, is, by all accounts, an incredibly delightful, non-intimidating person. I’ve performed on stages in front of 5000+ person crowds. I’ve spoken to hundreds of thousands of people around the US. I’ve done stand-up comedy on a stage in a country where the material I was performing could have landed me in jail, or worse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So why am I so nervous about this?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
