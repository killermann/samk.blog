As a poor person who creates tons of websites that have a ton of traffic but are totally free and make negative dollars, I feel like I’ve found the Holy Grail. But before I get into the details, two quick things:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One, &lt;strong>none of the following links are affiliates/sponsored&lt;/strong> (I don’t abide that sort of thing here).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two, &lt;strong>this path isn’t for everyone&lt;/strong>, but I’m going to lay it out for those of you who want to walk it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just wanted to get that out of the way, because I know that the excitement that’s bubbling out of me might be misread as a sales pitch or proselytizing. It’s not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We good? Good. Omg. Can I tell you how excited I am?!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
