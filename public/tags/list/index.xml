What it’s become, however, is one of my favorite parts of my day, every day for the past 62. While there is no goal to this project beyond to write more — nothing I’m trying to accomplish with the articles — there have been a few thoughts that have stuck out.</description></item><item><title>14 Simple Ways to Treat Every Day More Like Christmas</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/treat-every-day-like-christmas/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2013 05:43:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/treat-every-day-like-christmas/</guid><description>Christmas Time is a few days (or weeks, or months, at this point), when a lot of us change the ways we approach our life and the people in it.
There are a lot of positive changes that are part of that shift, things that would likely make the rest of us our year a bit more merry if we were intentional about them all twelve months.</description></item><item><title>100+ Tips for Minimalism</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/minimalism-tips/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Dec 2013 01:52:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/minimalism-tips/</guid><description>Kidding. 100 would be a bit excessive, and likely more than a bit counterintuitive, wouldn’t it? It’s easy for us to be seduced by a lot, and to think that more is better, but we rarely need more than a little.</description></item><item><title>20+ Simple Tips for Living Mindfully</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/tips-for-living-mindfully/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2013 04:39:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/tips-for-living-mindfully/</guid><description>Mindfulness is happiness. But you already know that. But what is mindfulness, beyond the abstract definition of “attentive, aware, or careful” that I gave in that other article? Being more mindful means tapping into all of your senses. If you’re more of a concrete person, here are a bunch of examples of how you can live a more mindful life.</description></item><item><title>Three Days Computerless</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/three-days-computerless/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2013 05:16:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/three-days-computerless/</guid><description>I should have my computer back tomorrow. Living without it these past few days has been odd, in some ways more expected than others.
I’ve realized how generally worthless I am to the world without a computer to mash myself through, like how you mash flour and water through a pasta press then voila!</description></item><item><title>These 6 Videos will Change the Way You Look at Unregulated Capitalism</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/rethinking-capitalism-videos/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2013 23:49:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/rethinking-capitalism-videos/</guid><description>RSA Animate: The Crises of Capitalism Wealth Inequality in America Naomi Klein: Addicted to Risk Alain de Botton: A Kinder, Gentler Philosophy of Success The Overview Effect Nic Marks: The Happy Planet Index</description></item><item><title>Reasons I Know My Heart is in Austin, Texas</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/my-heart-in-austin-texas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2013 04:37:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/my-heart-in-austin-texas/</guid><description>I travel a lot for work. As anyone who travels for work will know, people always say, “You get to travel a lot? That must be nice!” And it is nice. It’s fun to see all the different nooks and crannies of the United States, and I love meeting people from all the different walks of life I do.</description></item><item><title>Trying to Overcome the Numbers that Rule My Life</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/numbers-rule-my-life/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2013 20:35:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/numbers-rule-my-life/</guid><description>&lt;p>I never considered myself a “numbers” person. I don’t mean I wasn’t good at math (Mathlete, y’all!), but I care more about stories than stats. On the Myers-Briggs Typology Instrument, for example, my F to T (Feeling to Thinking) ratio is the most unbalanced, and I’m a _strong _F.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I do — every &lt;em>thing&lt;/em> I do — while seemingly disparate, is all connected by that trait. Every little project or endeavor I undertake is driven by my goal of making the world a safer place for all people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it’s as surprising to me as it might be to you how numbers-driven my day-to-day life is, and how much I find myself trying to turn that part of my brain off so I can focus on the present. The numbers eat at me, often glaring at me from within little red circles, screaming “Click me! Make me go away!” Others are tucked away within more complex websites or spreadsheets, whispering more gently, but still persuasively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following is a small taste of the numbers that are almost always whizzing around my brain, attempting to distract me from the task at hand. Every one of these things pops into my head at once when I wake up every morning, then attempts to suckle my brainjuice every minute of every hour I’m awake.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I Don’t Believe in God, but I Do Believe in A Lot</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/i-dont-believe-in-god/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Nov 2013 17:35:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/i-dont-believe-in-god/</guid><description>I don’t believe in God. Saying this is easier now than it was when I was a kid, because I was struggling equal parts internally with my lack of faith and externally with the reactions of people in my life when they found out.</description></item><item><title>Halloween, As Viewed Through Many Eyes</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/halloween-through-many-eyes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2013 19:39:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/halloween-through-many-eyes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. It is the one time of the year when it is acceptable — even encouraged — to be whoever, or whatever, you want to be — to pretend, to take chances, to wear gaudy lipstick.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Growing up, crafting costumes and living as someone else for a night was something I looked forward to the entire year — far more than the punch-you-in-your-pancreas sugar overdose, though who doesn’t prefer their apples covered in a gravy of melted sugar and butter, the way God intended. As an adult (or at least as “adult” as I ever plan on getting), so much of my time and work is focused on helping people understand identity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The irony is not lost on me.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
