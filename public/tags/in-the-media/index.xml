Political discourse is at a place where it’s hard — if not impossible — to see it as productive. Most times, it doesn’t even seem like folks who are arguing have a vision for anything being accomplished by that argument, other than hearing words yelled.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p class="graf graf--p">
Facts have been weaponized and are lobbed as projectiles, not used as tools to build a bridge from one perspective to another. Opinions are worn like armor, used to protect ourselves from the bombardment of facts. We scream for our ideas to drown out the screams of others for theirs.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p class="graf graf--p">
If sports are modeled after war, as many people say, our political discourse has taken a form modeled after the way we talk about sports.

Sam Killermann here. Or, as I’m being described on your Facebook Page, “Sin with Colored Pencils” here. I read the “blog post” you wrote about me and my “Genderbread Person.” To be “honest,” I couldn’t put together exactly what you were “trying” to say.</description></item><item><title>Let’s Be Honest: We’re Already Dating Our Phones</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/we-are-dating-our-phones/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2014 05:58:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/we-are-dating-our-phones/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yo. I just saw &lt;em>Her.&lt;/em> It’s cray. It’s powerfully well-written and brings up a lot of thoughts about how we might relate to technology and one another in the future. But it also made me think a lot about how we relate to technology and one another right now. If you have a smart phone and you’ve seen &lt;em>Her&lt;/em>, you’ve likely had a lot of these thoughts already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s hard to convince myself that we’re not already dating our phones.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>30 Ways The Top Ten Most Mind Blowing Facts You Would Never Expect About Jennifer Lawrence Absolutely Kinda Restored Our Faith In Humanity And Crushed Our Souls</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/30-mind-blowing-facts-internet-is-broken/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2014 05:27:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/30-mind-blowing-facts-internet-is-broken/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Sorry, Internet, but my mind isn’t, has never been, and will likely remain unblown. But every time you trick me into clicking on one of your linkbaity lists or videos I die a &lt;/span>little inside. Because I want to care. I do care. A lot. But there’s only so much someone can _actually _care, let’s call it the Caring Tolerance™. I’m starting to worry that you’re abusing people’s attention and increasing our Caring Tolerance™ the way a college student treats their liver first semester.&lt;span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&lt;br /> &lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can’t tell you how many times I’ve rage-read “my last” Buzzfeed article swearing I’d never go back to the site for anything but good ol’ fashioned America’s Funniest Home Videos style laughs. But then I see an article with “faith in humanity” in the title and my mouse hand moves faster than my brain. Then I’m back to rage-reading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How many times can I read THIS WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE and have it do absolutely nothing, before I start to think nothing will? Or, worse, how much empathy can I be coerced into experiencing by over-the-top, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gspElv1yvc">SPCA Sara McLachlan&lt;/a> wannabe videos on Upworthy before I can’t experience genuine empathy for the people in my immediate life (who aren’t soon-to-be-executed dogs, but still need love)?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>You Should Watch the Movie “About Time”</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/you-should-watch-the-movie-about-time/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2014 05:41:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/you-should-watch-the-movie-about-time/</guid><description>&lt;p>I hadn’t really heard much about &lt;em>About Time&lt;/em>, the newest Love-Actually-Notting-Hill-Brit-Rom-Com-warm-fuzzy delight. And, to be honest, while I love watching feel-good movies (because they, you know, make me &lt;a href="//new-years-resolutions-happy-world/" title="If Everyone Made these 12 New Year’s Resolutions, the World Would Be Happier">feel good&lt;/a>), I don’t generally have high expectations for them. They tend to be rather empty.&lt;/p>

Please stop ruining today’s children.
I would love to stop there, because I think the sassiness of one sentence is an appropriate response to the hollowness of your programming, but I refuse to stoop to your level. Earlier tonight, while at a laundromat, I was subjected to an hour of your work, a show called _Jessie.</description></item><item><title>The Abusive Relationship We’re All In That Most of Us Never Think About</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/abusive-gender-stereotypes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2013 03:17:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/abusive-gender-stereotypes/</guid><description>I saw this wonderful commercial earlier today and shared it on Facebook immediately.
