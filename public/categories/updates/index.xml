Here’s how I’m making decisions.</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/after-7-years-doing-this-work-im-re-branding-heres-how-im-making-decisions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Mar 2018 23:20:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/after-7-years-doing-this-work-im-re-branding-heres-how-im-making-decisions/</guid><description>&lt;p>I got thrown into this. Two-fold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I got thrown into the work I’ve been doing. And I got thrown into a situation that’s led me to question everything, rethink and restructure, and make decisions that feel like an overall “brand.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While I’m happy I’m here, one of the strongest forces that’s guiding what I do next is precisely avoiding how I got here: no more being thrown into stuff. Seem easy? Maybe. Probably not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ll get to that in a second, but first the back story.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Totally new site. Slightly new direction.</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/totally-new-site-slightly-new-direction/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Mar 2018 04:52:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/totally-new-site-slightly-new-direction/</guid><description>Howdy! Today marks two turning points: the design of this site has changed (from this to this), and the name has changed (from “Dear World” to “Sam Killermann’s Blog”).
From here on, in addition to things I’ve been writing about before (like happiness &amp;amp; technology), I’ll also be writing about how I DIY (do it myself) in all things social good &amp;amp; online platform related, and posting more personal updates about my work/life.</description></item><item><title>2016, A Brief Review of Creativity</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/2016-brief-review-creativity/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 02:08:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/2016-brief-review-creativity/</guid><description>&lt;p>2016 was, well, _quite _the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all, I side with what appears to be the consensus that it was, if given only one descriptor, a dumpster fire. That said, it was also more than a dumpster fire, and I want to take a moment to reflect on some of the things I made this year — something I basically never do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, with that said, following is what I finished, published, and/or created in 2016.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Meet FacilitatingXYZ: A Free Online Resource for ALL Facilitators</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/why-im-so-excited-about-facilitatingxyz/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2016 13:02:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/why-im-so-excited-about-facilitatingxyz/</guid><description>&lt;address>
&lt;strong>Updated September 12, 2016:&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;we&amp;nbsp;officially launched this project, after about 11 months in development, production, and ideation. Woohoo!
&lt;/address>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://facilitating.xyz">FacilitatingXYZ&lt;/a> is everything I wish I had when I got started as a facilitator — and &lt;a href="http://facilitating.xyz/manifesto">together&lt;/a>, we can build it into something that helps us continue to learn, develop, and grow. It’s a free online resource with videos, articles, downloads and (soon!) community to help all facilitators improve their craft.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I’m Publishing A Book</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/im-publishing-a-book/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2015 04:45:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/im-publishing-a-book/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m writing from a rooftop in Austin, taking a break from my break — which was part Naomi Klein and part Real Ale — to share a reflection that just sunk in: I’m about to publish my first book, and I couldn’t be more excited.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, to be clear: this isn’t me publishing the first book I wrote (that happened a couple years ago, and still hasn’t sunk in); this is me, under the auspices of &lt;a href="http://impetus.pw">Impetus Books&lt;/a>, publishing my first book someone else wrote (in this case, I’m glowingly happy to say that someone else is Karen Rayne).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I’m terrified.

One-on-one. And the instructor, Mady, is, by all accounts, an incredibly delightful, non-intimidating person. I’ve performed on stages in front of 5000+ person crowds. I’ve spoken to hundreds of thousands of people around the US. I’ve done stand-up comedy on a stage in a country where the material I was performing could have landed me in jail, or worse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So why am I so nervous about this?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Starstruck</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/starstruck/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2014 07:25:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/starstruck/</guid><description>I would have replied, but I didn’t know my voice would be so hard to find. You don’t get starstruck, I kept telling myself, but maybe I’d never seen a real star. She felt like a star.

To those who have followed my work, I understand that the topic (faith) and setting (a church) feel like they are coming out of left field. And that feeling couldn’t be more right — that’s why I’m doing this show.</description></item><item><title>What I Miss About Grad School</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/what-i-miss-about-grad-school/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2014 06:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/what-i-miss-about-grad-school/</guid><description>Earlier tonight, my friend texted me “I’m over this whole constantly chasing the homework train business.”
She was talking about grad school, and sharing a sentiment I shared back when I was earning my master’s. But, a bit to my surprise, I replied, “I miss grad school.</description></item><item><title>Gender Expression vs. Cueing, &amp; How Sometimes They’re One-in-the-Same</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/gender-expression-vs-cueing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2014 19:20:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/gender-expression-vs-cueing/</guid><description>Last week I gave three back-to-back shows at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.

It’s a lot. And as I type that, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed.</description></item><item><title>My First Live S.E.X.

I don’t remember the wording, but I don’t think it was anything less tongue-in-cheek than “Wanna do a sex show in Austin?”
Um. Yes.</description></item><item><title>Do, Reflect, Tweak, Do: From Thought/Day to Dear World</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/rethinking-thought-per-day/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2014 00:13:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/rethinking-thought-per-day/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I first started this project several months ago, I was &lt;a href="//welcome/" title="Welcome to Sam Killermann’s Thought / Day">pretty clear&lt;/a> about what my goal was with the writing here: in short, nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted a space to explore new ideas, to reflect, to write, to share, but without any particular “goal.” So much of the writing I do is extremely goal-oriented. I wanted to see what would happen if I created a space that was less structured. I wasn’t sure what I’d end up writing about, what shape this site would take, and was happy to follow my fingers on an adventure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it was fun. I wrote a lot of things I’d’ve never written otherwise, found that I have thoughts about seemingly random things that others find value in reading. I only got a few pieces of hatemail compared to a pile of encouragemail — this was new. I started with only one real rule, but I broke it after about 100 days. I was planning on writing once a day, and when I started traveling a lot at the beginning of this year, I missed one day. And that’s the funny thing about &lt;a href="//protecting-good-habits/">habits&lt;/a> — one missed day is alarmingly similar to one missed month, then you’re only a hop &amp;amp; skip away from a &lt;em>never happening again ever.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After missing a few days, I experienced stress related to this project that I hadn’t experienced, and decided that it was time to take a break from it, reflect, and see if it still has a healthy place in my life. I’ve done that now, and I’m happy to say that it does. &lt;em>Kinda.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gone is &lt;em>Sam Killermann’s Thought / Day&lt;/em>. Welcome _Dear World, _a much more fitting title for what’s going to be happening here.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I’m Sick With Career</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/sick-with-career/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2014 05:59:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/sick-with-career/</guid><description>When I came to Austin a few years ago I had nothing, at least relative to what I “have” now. I’ve achieved much and gained a lot in a short amount of time, which are all good things. Well, mostly good.</description></item><item><title>Be Bored</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/be-bored/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2014 05:47:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/be-bored/</guid><description>&lt;p>Be bored.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stop. Whatever else you’re doing. Stop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turn off your music. Turn off the TV, Netflix Instant Streaming, Hulu+, Amazon Prime, all the things you use to fill your time. Not forever, not for long, but for right now, this moment, stop.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Protecting Good Habits</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/protecting-good-habits/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2014 05:56:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/protecting-good-habits/</guid><description>We’ve heard it a million times: “old habits die hard.” But that’s not true. Truly, “bad habits die hard.” I can attest to this, using this Thought/Day project as an example.
Up until last week, I was 81 for 81 days in a row of writing and publishing a thought each day.</description></item><item><title>I’m Not Going To Teach You Anything New</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/im-not-going-to-teach-you-anything/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2014 05:54:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/im-not-going-to-teach-you-anything/</guid><description>That’s something one of my professors in grad school would lead off with in the first class of the semester.

All last year, I said it again and again, we&amp;#8217;re on the cusp of something great. Sites trying to create positive change in the world dominate my social media feeds.

Depicting four vastly different mes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A Me who hates families, Christians, and Christian families. Who is dedicated to “destroying Western Civilization” and will be promptly burning in Hell.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A Me who is saintlike in his love and compassion for others, who is “a glimpse of light in a world that’s gotten dark.” Whose work “literally saved my life.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A Me who is motivated solely by ulterior motives, greed, and who would “best serve the LGBT community by killing yourself.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

Sam Killermann here. Or, as I’m being described on your Facebook Page, “Sin with Colored Pencils” here.

I just saw &lt;em>Her.&lt;/em> It’s cray. It’s powerfully well-written and brings up a lot of thoughts about how we might relate to technology and one another in the future. But it also made me think a lot about how we relate to technology and one another right now. If you have a smart phone and you’ve seen &lt;em>Her&lt;/em>, you’ve likely had a lot of these thoughts already.&lt;/p>

Even now, in The Year Two-Thousand Fourteen, I have to describe what I do with those five words. A talk I heard recently by Heather Corinna, another person who works &lt;a title="So Good." href="http://scarleteen.com" target="_blank">on the internet&lt;/a>, who spoke about working on the internet, was a reminder of this for me, as I found myself relating to everything she said. Five words still when it should really be two:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“On the internet” means a ton of things to a ton of different people. “That’s so techy” or “my, how quickly things change!” often translates to me as “ARE YOU FROM THE FUTURE?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For some people “on the internet” undoes the “I work” part: “Oh, neat, yeah, but what’s your real job?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is my real job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We live in the future, people. There are no flying cars (&lt;a href="http://www.irishmirror.ie/news/world-news/terrafugia-flying-cars-could-sale-2998745" target="_blank">soon&lt;/a>! wanna go halfsies?), but there are shabbily-dressed people working on laptops in coffee shops. The future is here, and it’s unshaven. The only reason we’re still making the “on the internet” distinction is because of the [sometimes willful] ignorance about what the world looks like and how much things have changed in a short amount of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to play catch up (please, do not think any of what I’m suggesting here is anywhere near the cutting edge), let me share with you a few starter steps for working on the internet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MacBooker’s Creed</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/macbook-creed/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2014 05:54:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/macbook-creed/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is my MacBook.

I would love to stop there, because I think the sassiness of one sentence is an appropriate response to the hollowness of your programming, but I refuse to stoop to your level.

When I set out on this adventure I was hoping to accomplish several things, a couple in particular: to learn more about myself and get the ideas that rattle around in my head out into words.</description></item><item><title>Why I’ve Never Been a Fan of “Self Help” Books</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/self-help-books/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2013 05:37:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/self-help-books/</guid><description>I’ve only ever read one, maybe two, “self help” books (depending on how strict your definition is). Not for me. And I wouldn’t want to foist them on anyone else. Might seem odd, considering what I write here. That’s one of the reasons I’ve been so reluctant to write about the things I write about here: because I don’t like the idea of “self help” coming from another person.</description></item><item><title>The Most Wild Year of My Life Ended in One Moment</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/how-my-year-ended/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2013 04:47:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/how-my-year-ended/</guid><description>Earlier tonight I gave the opening keynote for the Nat’l Sex Ed Conference. It was an hour that I’ve spent the last 6 months mulling, refining, trashing, rebuilding, trashing, reconceiving, and then, tonight, finally talking. I’ve never given a talk like that — not even close.</description></item><item><title>Three Days Computerless</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/three-days-computerless/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2013 05:16:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/three-days-computerless/</guid><description>I should have my computer back tomorrow. Living without it these past few days has been odd, in some ways more expected than others.
I’ve realized how generally worthless I am to the world without a computer to mash myself through, like how you mash flour and water through a pasta press then voila!</description></item><item><title>My Computer Died, but that’s Good</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/my-computer-died/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2013 01:14:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/my-computer-died/</guid><description>&lt;p>I woke up this morning to my computer not working. It’s not been in great shape these past few months, and has occasionally tossed a surprise my way. It’s several years old, and I’ve put it through plenty of hell with all my traveling (and general clumsiness). I’d already been investigating new options, and weighing the pros and cons. I knew its time was drawing near.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a lot of work on my plate right now, and a lot of it’s time sensitive. And chief thing on my mind is the Nat’l Sex Ed Conference next week, for which I’m excited to be one of the keynotes. I have a few pressing collaborations, plenty of more people who I’ve promised e-love to, and some big personal projects that are underway. Objectively, it’s not an ideal time for my computer to bail on me. But subjectively, I’m excited for a few days without my computer, amidst a few of the days this year I most crushingly want to feel like I _need _it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>If Full-Scale Revolution Started, Where Would You Be?</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/your-revolutionary-role/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2013 22:43:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/your-revolutionary-role/</guid><description>I want to start by letting the NSA know this is purely a thought experiment.

Generally more than once a day. It’s a term we all toss around, and we generally use it to mean “everyone who plays video games.</description></item><item><title>Catalytic Friends</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/catalytic-friends/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2013 04:55:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/catalytic-friends/</guid><description>It’s rare that it’s a good thing to be in a coffee shop, slurping coffee, at 11:30 pm. But last night, boisterously laughing throughout an otherwise intense philosophical conversation, slurping coffee until midnight was exactly a good thing.
I spent the night working and talking with a close friend of mine, in what’s become a routine of ours: late night “cofficing,” a term he coined, that sometimes is more work than conversation, and other times more conversation than work, but is always exactly what we need.</description></item><item><title>Let Your Teacher Grade Your Test</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/let-your-teacher-grade-your-test/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2013 04:38:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/let-your-teacher-grade-your-test/</guid><description>I did a show earlier today, which isn’t that odd, or thought-provoking.

We’re tricked5, by ourselves6, and by influences in our life7, into being mislead without even realizing we’re being mislead8. It’s the most dangerous form of dishonesty9, because it exploits our inherent want to trust10, and turns our own good faith against us11, like a knife with a sharp handle and a dull blade12.</description></item><item><title>Hiding Behind a Keyboard: The Terror of the Unknown</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/hiding-behind-a-keyboard/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2013 04:13:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/hiding-behind-a-keyboard/</guid><description>I used to be terrified of any sort of public speaking. This terror was justified by my complete inability to speak to any group larger than 2 – 3. Before my first semester at Purdue, during orientation, we were always asked to introduce ourselves with our “Name, Hometown, Major” — something I couldn’t do without fumbling over my words and screwing something up.</description></item><item><title>Why I Ride the Bus</title><link>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/why-i-ride-the-bus/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2013 15:48:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/why-i-ride-the-bus/</guid><description>I ride the bus.
I ride the bus because it’s good for the environment
&amp;amp; it makes for a smaller carbon footprint
&amp;amp; it helps me afford my month-to-month rent
But truly none of that is it.

It is the one time of the year when it is acceptable — even encouraged — to be whoever, or whatever, you want to be — to pretend, to take chances, to wear gaudy lipstick.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Growing up, crafting costumes and living as someone else for a night was something I looked forward to the entire year — far more than the punch-you-in-your-pancreas sugar overdose, though who doesn’t prefer their apples covered in a gravy of melted sugar and butter, the way God intended. As an adult (or at least as “adult” as I ever plan on getting), so much of my time and work is focused on helping people understand identity.&lt;/p>
