Every time I visit the Ontario countryside, I’m struck by how much it reminds me of my now-home state of Texas, in ways that are equal parts comfy (lots of hospitality) and uncomfy (lots of camouflage and usage of the word “lifestyle”). But this trip was different.</p><p id=28ff class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In years past, the ideas I was presenting (i.e., social justice and anti-oppression concepts, centered around gender) were mostly received as new. And the questions aligned with that. But this year, a lot of the questions I was hearing weren’t responding to what I was saying on stage, as much as they were addressing things that were already bouncing around students’ minds before I got there. I just became the first “spokesperson” for social justice they were able to confront IRL.</p><p id=5116 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, in years past I got a lot of questions about things like “What do you mean gender and sexuality aren’t the same?” Or “What do you mean a woman can’t ‘oppress’ a man?”</p><p id=b2a7 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But this year, a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">bunch </em>of times (double digits) during Q&As I was asked something that amounted to “So gender is a social construct, and so is race, so why are we accepting of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlyn_Jenner target=_blank rel="nofollow noopener" data-href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlyn_Jenner>Caitlyn Jenner</a> but not <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Dolezal target=_blank rel="nofollow noopener" data-href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Dolezal>Rachel Dolezal</a>?” By high schoolers. In rural Texas Ontario.</p><p id=5bb9 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hold that thought. I’ll return to it, but first I want to take a step back.</p><h3 id=f2a2 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Over a Decade of a Creeping Feeling</h3><p id=f9b4 class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I’ve been involved in the social justice movement (SJM) for most of my life.</p><p id=7cb2 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In high school, I did what I could to protest the Iraq War (made signs, tried [failed] to organize big “walk outs,” etc.), but my first big leap into activism happened when I drove out to Washington DC to turn <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_Your_Back_on_Bush target=_blank rel="nofollow noopener" data-href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_Your_Back_on_Bush>my back on Bush</a> at his <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_20,_2005_counter-inaugural_protest target=_blank rel="nofollow noopener" data-href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_20,_2005_counter-inaugural_protest>re-inauguration in 2005</a>. I wasn’t old enough to vote when W. was re-elected, so I decided I would express my voice another way: by driving 642 miles from Indiana to D.C. in my beat up old car with about $50 to my name for gas and food so I could symbolically turn my back on him when he passed me in the parade.</p><p id=5576 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have zero regrets.</p><p id=4ba1 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I didn’t know the phrase “social justice” then, but those protests in high school were when I first waded into this world — a world I’ve occupied in a dozen different ways since.</p><p id=361c class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the past decade, I’ve participated in tons of social justice activism, art, and education — as both learner and educator, consumer and creator.</p><p id=65e0 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And all the while, as I became more and more invested in this movement, eventually dedicating my life to it, there was something floating around in the ether I couldn’t put my finger on — a message that only existed in the lines between the written words on the page.</p><p id=0819 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sometimes it felt like a tug, or a nudge, or a push. Other times it felt like a whitewater rapid, sweeping me out from beneath my feet and carrying me downstream, to a place I couldn’t quite recognize, without a sense of my bearings.</p><p id=9c85 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I realized only a few years ago that I wasn’t the only one feeling it, as I started to have (private, sometimes-scary) conversations with fellow social justice educators, activists, and colleagues about this creeping feeling.</p><p id=e431 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The subjects of the conversations were always different, but the theme was consistently one of “are we the only ones?”</p><p id=0d6f class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Are we the only ones who are struggling with, don’t fully agree with, or don’t understand [X]? </strong>([X] being some new belief, stance, or action we were seeing a lot our friends in the SJM advancing)</p><p id=adf0 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the past few years, these hush-hush, “are we the only ones” conversations changed from being something I would rarely have, maybe with 1 colleague in 10 (usually after a conference, workshop, or controversial current event), to 3 out of 4. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The feeling kept coming up.</em></p><p id=750a class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As these conversations started to add up, and in the past two years really started to weigh on me, it became helpful for me have a label to define them (maybe in a “<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcDLzppD4Jc" target=_blank rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcDLzppD4Jc">name it to tame it</a>” sense?). A couple years ago, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“Social Justice Dogma”</strong> is what I came up with.</p><h3 id=b71e class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The First Rule of Social Justice Dogma is You Don’t Question the Social Justice Dogma</h3><p id=a474 class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Before I move forward, I want to define what I mean by the “Social Justice Dogma,” so we’re all on the same page:</p><blockquote id=ea5b class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p"><p><em class="markup--em markup--pullquote-em">The social justice dogma is the set of beliefs, stances, and acceptable actions laid down by the authorities within the social justice movement that we hold as incontrovertibly true.</em></p></blockquote><p id=c319 class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">It’s just a slight tweak on the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define+dogma&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS737US737&oq=define+dogma&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j35i39l2j0l3.1440j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target=_blank rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define+dogma&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS737US737&oq=define+dogma&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j35i39l2j0l3.1440j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">standard definition of dogma</a>, but in ways that have been really helpful in my understanding of this phenomenon. Let’s break it down.</p><p id=67b2 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> beliefs </strong>show up in the SJM as accepted facts, truths, and principles that we learn as we become part of the movement, and work to teach others.</p><p id=de54 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Stances </strong>show up most strongly as things, ideas, or people that we are — or <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">should be</em> — against. They also show up as things we should be for.</p><p id=a646 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Acceptable actions </strong>are the tactics we should use to put our beliefs and stances to work — all the ways we’re supposed to show up, interact with others (both inside and outside of the movement), and advance the cause.</p><p id=06fb class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">authorities </strong>part is the trickiest, because within the movement we have a lot of different authorities, but you can think of authorities generally as anyone, or any source (platform, org, publication, etc.), who is writing the rules above that we follow, and enforce amongst ourselves. Authorities are the “they” when someone says, “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">They</em> said you shouldn’t say/think/do that.” Authorities as sources show up when people say “I read on [source] that we should now say/think/do this.”</p><p id=1781 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And all of this adds up: “[Authority] said [belief] is true and we should show [stance] by [acceptable action].” What’s implied, but not often said, is “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">or we’ll be part of the problem.”</em></p><p id=b3c2 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, let me just take a hot second to say something loud and clear (I’ll even bold it):</p><p id=98c2 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A lot of the beliefs, stances, and acceptable actions we’re taught by authorities within the SJM aren’t bad; in fact, a lot of them are good, healthy, and helpful.</strong></p><p id=d505 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The stickiest, prickliest, and most important part of the above definition is the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“incontrovertibly true”</strong> part. The part of dogma that forbids the tenets from being challenged.</p><p id=015c class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I haven’t written about this, or spoken about it onstage, because talking about this publicly scares the hell out of me.</p><p id=d047 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And it scares everyone within the SJM I’ve talked with about it, to varying degrees.</p><p id=04f1 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I remember one convo I was having with fellow social justice educator two years ago, where we looked around the room, in which we were alone, and eerily half-joked “Doesn’t it feel like someone is listening?” And another with the executive director of a national queer rights organization who said to me “If this conversation was public, it would be the end of me, and my organization would probably never recover.”</p><p id=4600 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What were we so afraid of? The three of us all believe that systemic oppression is real, horrible, and something we should work to dismantle — indeed, we are doing that work daily. The thing that scared us was the feeling that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">even just questioning </strong>a certain idea or tactic (that’d we’d been told by some SJM authority to accept or embrace) was crossing some invisible line. An indelible line.</p><p id=5986 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And if people found out that we had those questions we’d be <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">out</em>. Alienated. Isolated. Alone. A pariah at best, a target at worst.</p><p id=7931 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have those thoughts a lot. It’s why writing this is so hard, and has taken so long.</p><h3 id=f4c8 class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Taking a new leap.</h3><p id=27f5 class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A few days after I was getting those questions in Ontario, a feminist philosopher argued the same parallel the students had highlighted in a journal article, and was <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypatia_transracialism_controversy target=_blank rel="nofollow noopener" data-href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypatia_transracialism_controversy>met with virulent backlash</a>. Whether we, or I, want them to or not, we can’t confine these conversations behind closed doors any more — they’re out in the world. And the decision I had to make was whether I wanted to participate or not.</p><p id=1073 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Talking about social justice dogma is going to be messy and challenging, it’s going to test my relationships (with fellow social justice folks, readers, and supporters of my work). It might be the end of me, and my organization may never recover.</p><p id=9181 class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But I think that, at this point, I see more at stake by being silent than I do by wading into the inevitable mess. I care too much about this movement, the folks I’m stewarding into it, and the goals of social justice. I’m done with the whispered conversations and closed doors. I need to talk about this, y’all, and I’m going to work through the fear.</p><p id=832a class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Consider this the beginning of my part of this conversation.</strong></p><hr><p><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Originally published at </em><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href=http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2017/12/introduction-social-justice-dogma/ target=_blank rel="nofollow noopener" data-href=http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2017/12/introduction-social-justice-dogma/><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">itspronouncedmetrosexual.com</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> on December 7, 2017.</em></p></section><footer class="entry-footer text-wrap"><span class=cat-links><a href=https://samkillermannblog.netlify.com/categories/better-humaning>Better Humaning</a></span>
