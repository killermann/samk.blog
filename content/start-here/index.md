I'm happy you're reading my blog! I'd written hundreds of posts here over the years, and I'd love to give you a good starting place for getting acquainted with the collection I'm putting together here.

<!-- I'll recommend some things below, but the easiest way to get an intro to my blog is to join my free mailing list. If you sign up here, it will automatically send you a selection of my best essays here over the next couple of weeks, at a happy pace:

{{< mailinglistintro >}} -->

You're welcome to just poke around. The main sections I divide my writing here into are...

- [Better Humaning](/categories/better-humaning/): ways to look at how we can be kinder, more human, healthy versions of ourselves
- [Technolophizing](/categories/technolophizing/): examining the ways technology contributes to, and gets in the way of, our lives
- [Adventravel](/categories/adventravel): missives from my adventures around the world, immersed in other cultures, highlighting my favorite style of travel

I also tend to write a lot of the following vibes:

- [How-To](/topics/how-to/): detailed instructions for doing a [new] thing, or a walkthrough of how I do it.
- [Challenge](/topics/challenge/): think "New Year's Resolution", but not limited to that day of the year. Personal challenges I'm setting myself to, where I invite you to play along.
- [List](/topics/list/): who doesn't love a good listicle?

Everything I publish here is meant to be evergreen, and as useful 3 years ago as it will be 3 years from now.

By default, all of the content on this site is arranged in reverse-chronological order. But that's not super helpful for someone getting here in, say, 2020, when a lot of the posts were published several years before.
