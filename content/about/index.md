There are so many possible abouts you could be curious&#8230; about. Let&#8217;s start with this one:

## About the Blog

This is a blog by [Sam Killermann][1]. Indeed, it&#8217;s Sam Killermann&#8217;s blog. Even more indeed, I am Sam Killermann, so it&#8217;s weird that I keep writing in third-person.

So, about _my_ blog.

Think of this as part open letter to the world, and part sharing experiences and observations of why I hold the world so dear. We only have one world, and one shot to live on it. We&#8217;re all crammed on it together, tightly packed. And it&#8217;s in all of our best interest, and in the interest of everything else smushed on this [pale blue dot][2] with us &#8212; sentient and seemingly not sentient &#8212; to live in ways that enhance the experiences of our global roommates.

Has pissing off your roommate ever really benefited you in the end? If so, send your experience to sam@doesntbelieveyou.lol.

**My goal with everything that I write here is for it to be a nudge toward some healthier, happier, or more whole way of living** &#8212; for myself, and for anyone who happens to read it. Little reminders, big call-to-actions, personal challenges. Things that I&#8217;m currently struggling with, things I feel like I have my mind wrapped around, and things I may be facing for the first time.

I&#8217;ve found that my writing here organically sorted itself into three overall buckets:

  * **[Better Humaning][3]**: where every post, in some way, answers the question &#8220;How can I be a better me, while creating space for others to be a better them?&#8221;
  * **[Technolophizing][4]**: where I write about the role technology plays in our lives, answering the question &#8220;How can we ensure technology is serving us, and our well-being &#8212; and not the other way around?&#8221;
  * **[Adventravel][5]**: stories from backpacking around the world, and other anecdotes and tidbits from a road.

As you&#8217;ve already likely noticed, there&#8217;s a lot of overlap between these themes. So beyond those buckets, the most common themes in my writing here are **[happiness][6]**, **[mindfulness][7]**, **[work][8]**, **[how-to][9]**, and &#8212; because everything I write about here is, in some way or another, about change &#8212; **[activism][10]**.

You can also browse the posts here by _format,_ instead of theme. The main formats I&#8217;m using are: 

  * **[Essays][11]**: exactly what you expect them to be, longer-form, written posts.
  * **[Quotes][12]**: short little lessons encapsulated into a sentence or two, from others and from myself
  * **[Statuses][13]**: think Facebook, but without all the weird data extortion and psychological manipulation
  * **[Links][12]**: things I&#8217;m excited to point you to, that don&#8217;t live here

I&#8217;ll write in clear language, with passion, from my heart to yours. And if you come along for the ride, I hope you&#8217;ll write back.

You can [read all about me on this &#8220;About Sam Killermann&#8221; page][14], but here&#8217;s a different &#8220;about&#8221; that&#8217;s focused on the relationship between this blog and me:

I&#8217;m a person who has dedicated their life to the well-being of others, and realized along the way that I can&#8217;t accomplish that without being healthier myself ([&#8220;sweep first before your own door&#8221;][15] and whatnot). 

This blog is about the that: the ways I&#8217;m trying to be healthier, calmer, whole-er &#8212; in service of that other goal.

I also do everything myself in my projects (from the writing, to the design, web development, animation, filming, performing, post-production, etc. &#8212; _all of it_), I am constantly learning. I&#8217;m learning about every layer of the stack I&#8217;m living in, and doing my best to put that learning into action immediately.

This blog is also about that: the things I&#8217;m learning, and how you can DIY, or benefit from my mistakes.

## About the Site

I built this site from the ground-up using [JAMstack][17] methodology. To make this site as fast, accessible, and environmentally sustainable as possible, I'm using Hugo to generate the pages, and I pared down everything I didn't need*. The theme I made is all open source and uncopyrighted, and you can [view it on Github][20].

*You might be wondering about the constantly shifting chameleon color scheme, and asking &#8220;Was _that_ a need?&#8221; Yes, my friend. Because it makes _me_ happy to visit this site, and I need to come here for this thing to work. So it was more than a need: it&#8217;s everything.
