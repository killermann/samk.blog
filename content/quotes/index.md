I love quotes. Something about encapsulating a big idea in a few words really does it for me. Some of these are quotes of mine (taken from longer essays, or that I find because others add them to [Quote Catalog](https://quotecatalog.com/communicator/sam-killermann/) or [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/7285318.Sam_Killermann)). Others are quotes of other people that have me rapt.
