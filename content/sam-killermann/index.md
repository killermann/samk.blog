If you know me from the interwebs, it&#8217;s likely through one of my [social good projects][1], [my book][2], my [gender-y TED Talk][3], or something else I co-created via [hues](https://hues.xyz). But I wanted this site to stand as a remaining bastion of quasi-personal space where I can explore ideas and share things away from the limelight that has become most of my other sites. That said, below are a few disclosures about me.

I have a whole website that serves as my virtual curriculum vitae, so if you wanna know about [me][4] and my [work][5], head over to [samuelkillermann.com][6] and click around. You can start [here to learn what I&#8217;m up to right now][7].

Oh, you haven&#8217;t clicked? You just wanna learn about me here? Okay. I see. I&#8217;ll abide.

## Some brags and history, in [auto-]biographical format.

_The following is based on my generic bio that I send to people when they hire me to do a thing and need to include a thing that tells people at the thing why I was asked to do the thing. For the most updated version, [go here][8]._

<p class="has-drop-cap">
  I am a comedian, author, and award-winning activist. For about a decade, I've traveled the world performing comedy shows and giving talks on themes of social justice, gender, and sexuality.
</p>

My work (that I [uncopyrighted in 2013](https://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/uncopyright)) has been downloaded by hundreds of millions of people around the world who utilize it to bolster their educational efforts toward global equity. My versions of the [Genderbread Person][9], a model for understanding and teaching gender and sexual diversity, have been translated into over a dozen languages.

In 2017, I was profiled in National Geographic’s documentary [“Gender Revolution: A Journey with Katie Couric](http://natgeotv.com/ca/gender-revolution). In 2014, I designed an [all-gender restroom sign][10] that I gifted to the commons, which is now being implemented on [at least] three continents, was featured in the White House, and is becoming the standard for dozens of communities around the U.S. and world.

I'm the author (and co-author) of several books, including [A Guide to Gender][11], which is an exploration of gender from a social justice perspective, with humor and comics sprinkled in. The book opened as the #1 bestseller in gender on Amazon, and as a reflection of Sam’s commitment to access as a core social justice value, I've donated over 25,000 copies of the book. I've done three TED talks, including [“Understanding the Complexities of Gender,”][12] which has over 370,000 views, where I distilled the core themes of the book into a few minutes of fun, energetic, and easily-digestible speech.

I'm the co-creator of [TheSafeZoneProject.com][13] (with [Meg Bolger](https://megbolger.com)), a free online resource for LGBTQ+ and Ally training materials. Our open source curriculum is being used by over 30,000 educators in at least 150 countries.

Outside of my key initiatives, I'm a frequent [keynote speaker](https://samtalkto.us/) (I've done about 100), I make political shirts for [EveryShirtIsPolitical][14], co-facilitate [FacilitatingXYZ][15], and I was named a “Person We Love” by Yes! Magazine and Austin “Changemaker." When I'm not on the road, I'm mostly [cuddling my pups](https://instagram.com/killermann), and I like to spend at least a few hours a day bicycling around sunny Austin, TX, where he counts himself lucky to live.
