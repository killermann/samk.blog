It&#8217;s weird, ya know, waking up to emails from four different people I don&#8217;t know, who don&#8217;t know me, but think they do. Depicting four vastly different mes:

1. A Me who hates families, Christians, and Christian families. Who is dedicated to &#8220;destroying Western Civilization&#8221; and will be promptly burning in Hell.

2. A Me who is saintlike in his love and compassion for others, who is &#8220;a glimpse of light in a world that&#8217;s gotten dark.&#8221; Whose work &#8220;literally saved my life.&#8221;

3. A Me who is motivated solely by ulterior motives, greed, and who would &#8220;best serve the LGBT community by killing yourself.&#8221;<!--more-->

4. A Me who is &#8220;as insignificant as anyone could be&#8221; which is why it&#8217;s doubly grievous &#8220;to keep pretending otherwise.&#8221;

Which Me is the real me? None of them. And all of them. For each person has created a Me in their mind and that Me, while it isn&#8217;t and never will be me, is as real as I am.

When I started this project I was hoping it would help people know who I am &#8212; to meet the real me. An unfortunate byproduct of working on the Internet is being dehumanized. This site was meant to re-person me.

Looking back now, I realize the mistake I made: nobody is going to take the time to read and learn about me when they already know who the real Me is.
