I&#8217;m really excited, y&#8217;all. Ever since starting the podcast, I&#8217;ve been wanting to get one of my favorite people in the world slash friend, Ian Tennant, to record a conversation with me. You know back when I wrote that [catalytic friends][1] post? He&#8217;s who I was talking about.

Well, we finally made it happen. It will be the first of many, and I think it&#8217;ll be a treat for those of you who have been tuning into the Thought of the Week podcast. Remember, you can subscribe on iTunes and Soundcloud, and if you appreciated hearing from Ian let him know (maybe we can convince him to be a regular fixture).

Here&#8217;s the quote Ian mentions:

> “It usually takes me more than three weeks to prepare a good impromptu speech.”
  
> &#8211; Mark Twain

Intro track by Rustik Jamz. Check them out: @[rustik-jamz][2]

Also, let me know if the coffee shop background noise is too much &#8212; we wanted to have some ambience, but I don&#8217;t want it to be distracting.
