For the past 7 days, my life was consumed by the flu. Technically, I was more couch-ridden than bedridden, but I was decidedly _horizontal_. Luckily, I had a [faithful guardian][1] who didn&#8217;t leave my side, so I survived.

This is the first time I&#8217;ve had the flu in as long as I can remember. I don&#8217;t get sick often. The last time I was even &#8220;take a day off work&#8221; sick was over a year ago (and I don&#8217;t even have to get a doctor&#8217;s note to call in &#8212; I have [lenient bosses][2]).

Yesterday, as I was catching up on the [SNL I missed][3], I realized I didn&#8217;t get most of the jokes because I hadn&#8217;t been keeping up with politics or the news (or even trying). 

Today, something else hit me, as I started to dive back into work and catch up with life, that I can attribute entirely to the flu:

**I don&#8217;t need to follow daily politics any more.**

I remember learning in Civics class in high school the importance of following current events. 

I don&#8217;t disagree with the ethos as it was taught then, in that political and informational climate. And I applaud my teacher for trying (even if failing) to get us to give a shit.

But in 2019, with every 24-hour News Corp pumping out half a dozen _Breaking News_-es every day, while every person in your social network feels obligated to weigh in with their totally-uninformed and inconsequential hot take, then we forget it all and start over tomorrow, I&#8217;m pretty sure following daily politics is hurting more than it&#8217;s helping.

I missed a week of politics, and I&#8217;m as close to certain as I can be that literally _nothing_ I missed will matter in another 7 days. It takes longer than that to develop a story of significance, something that has gravity, or the ability to change the future.

Now that we&#8217;re in the Presidential Election SeasonÂ® again (As if we ever left. We didn&#8217;t. I refuse to believe that we did.), I&#8217;m going to feel an increased pressure to follow daily politics. Maybe you will too.

And this is where I&#8217;ll double down: 

**I _need to not_ follow daily politics any more.**

It&#8217;s distracting, despite feeling important. It&#8217;s unhelpful, despite feeling helpful and necessary. It&#8217;s exhausting. It&#8217;s gossip. It&#8217;s poison.

Following daily politics is as helpful to someone wanting to be a good citizen as watching _The Bachelor_. 

And that&#8217;s not a slight against _The Bachelor_, or its fanbase: at least they&#8217;re honest about what they&#8217;re doing, and not pretending they&#8217;re producing something important.

So I&#8217;m out. 

I&#8217;ll catch up with the big stories at the end of each week, after they&#8217;ve developed, and let all the little clickbait, rage _du jour_, gossip stuff fall through the cracks.

Now, I&#8217;ll just need to find a way to limit my news to the weekly dose. And to have it be important stories. 

_If only there was a business that delivered news to people once a week &#8212; Maybe Sundays? Just tryin&#8217; things. Hear me out. &#8212; and you paid them a little bit each week to edit out all the nonsense and factual inaccuracies &#8212; We could call them &#8220;Editors.&#8221; Dang! I think that sounds great. That&#8217;s a business the 21st century needs._
