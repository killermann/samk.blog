<pre>I got an email from a friend with the question above. I am always spinning a ton of plates, so how do I keep them from crashing? Here's [basically -- just a <em>little </em>edited] what I replied.</pre>

First, I&#8217;ll say that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m very good at this at all. I have a ton of things always happening, for sure, and I&#8217;m productive in getting things done, but my life is a circus.

If it weren&#8217;t for the relatively new help of my manager Chum and project coordinator Bethany the lions and tigers and bears would likely have won by now. Thankfully, they serve as ringmasters that keep the beasts at bay, but I still wield a chair or three as well. All of the below things are available as free resources (other than the hard drives). They are all great for collaborating (ditto). And they work on my phone, tablet, computer, and web browser (ditto, ditto).

## To remember ideas, I use Evernote

I have different journals for different ideations within Evernote (e.g., a comedy one, an IPM one, one for my album, one for each of my books, etc.) but use the same tag system for everything, so I can draw connections.

For example, I originally wrote my gender TEDx talk to be a song, so I tagged it &#8220;lyrics&#8221; and while it changed from there, it still comes up when I&#8217;m looking at &#8220;lyrics&#8221; to see all the songs I&#8217;ve written, which I like (cuz it could be easily changed back).

## To remember actions, I use Wunderlist

I have about 60 &#8211; 70 Wunderlists going at any given time. I have one for each of my live personal projects (things like IPM site, Jack and/or Jill, etc., which is about 30ish), one for each of my collaborations that are still ongoing (like the Safe Zone Project), for every freelance gig I have open, and then I have some general life ones (e.g., &#8220;Rainy Day in Austin,&#8221; &#8220;Things I Need to Buy&#8221;).

Some of the tasks have due dates, which makes it easy to know what I have to get done +today (by browsing the due &#8221; +Today&#8221; tab), if anything. But if that&#8217;s not absolutely necessary, they don&#8217;t. And I just open a list and work through it when I&#8217;m inspired to work on that project.

I also recently started doing &#8220;pre&#8221; and &#8220;post&#8221; lists for speaking/shows/trips, and I&#8217;ve really liked that idea. &#8220;Pre&#8221; is things to pack, print, buy, etc. &#8220;Post&#8221; is all follow-ups I accumulate while I&#8217;m there. And I have those forever until they&#8217;re complete, like the one from a trip I did back in January that is still not complete. Gotta get on that.

## To get started on writing and creation, I use Google Drive

Right now, I have 22 top level folders in my Google Drive. As you&#8217;re starting to likely get the sense, I use these separations to help me stay organized. But for Google Drive, I don&#8217;t separate just by project, but also by collaborators. I give Chum and Bethany access to all of my personal projects, so there&#8217;s just a &#8220;CHUM & BETHANY & SAM&#8221; folder. I share access to that folder with them once, then they have everything inside, which includes everything from new articles I&#8217;m writing for a variety of sites, to bios, to show schedules, to contracts, to budgets.

Some of my other top level folders are more broad, but all with the same goal of making the sharing easy. The only reason I&#8217;m writing and making things on Google Drive instead of my laptop is because I can click a button and allow someone else access (to edit, provide feedback, take over, etc.). So it&#8217;s with that in mind that I choose how I will organize what goes where.

## To finalize and publish, I use my laptop

Granted, I&#8217;m using my laptop for a lot of the things above as well, but here I mostly mean Adobe Creative Suite (for all the design and print stuff) and Sublime Text 2 (for programming web stuff). And I back up all of the finished products of everything on external hard drives.

To organize my computer, I created a new top level folder (on the same par as &#8220;Documents&#8221; and &#8220;Movies&#8221;) called &#8220;Projects.&#8221; In Projects, I have a subfolder for everything I&#8217;m currently actively working on. Everything finished or dormant stowed away on an external drive. The nice thing about the Projects folder is that now I can still use the Documents folder for what, I think, it was meant to be: a hodge-podge of personal things (like tax returns) and other files you&#8217;re not sure where to put (like resumes).

As far as backing things up, I have separate external hard drives for three different divisions of my work: photo/video (all on one hard drive), design, and organizational. So I know that if I need the raw video clip of a testimonial from a keynote that I gave three years ago, I plug in my blue hard drive where it&#8217;ll be organized hierarchically by type and date, and I can find it in 2 minutes. Ditto with a poster I made four years ago and haven&#8217;t thought of since (just happened as I was redesigning Dear World). Or an organizational structure and position descriptions for something I did in 2012. All on separate hard drives, waiting to be resurrected.

Each of those hard drives is backed up as well, of course. And my computer (with all of my live projects) gets backed up every couple of days on a separate hard drive altogether.

## I&#8217;ve tried a lot, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve ended up with, but&#8230;

I think the most important takeaway from all of this is that I&#8217;ve **tried a lot**. I&#8217;ve tried tons of different software, clever analog systems (like that one with the journal calendar, or that one with the flash cards) &#8212; I&#8217;ve gone just so far as to not go _<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=memento&es_sm=91&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=zk67U_uwBob5oASjk4GoAQ&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ#q=memento%20movie%20tattoos&revid=200960068&tbm=isch&imgdii=_" target="_blank">this far</a>._ But I think that&#8217;s the best thing I&#8217;ve done.

By trying and not loving a ton of different systems, I&#8217;ve landed on three things that work together in a way that perfectly complements my idea flow. Even if these specific practices don&#8217;t work for you, there is likely something that will. Don&#8217;t stop trying things out until you find it.
