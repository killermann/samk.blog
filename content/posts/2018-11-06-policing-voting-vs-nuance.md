You can complain about politics if you don&#8217;t vote.
  
You&#8217;re not a bad human if you don&#8217;t vote.
  
You can still be my friend if you don&#8217;t vote.
  
And voting is an exceptional way to complain.
  
And it&#8217;s a perfect way to stake a claim in your humanity.
  
And it&#8217;s a wonderful way to show up for your friends.
