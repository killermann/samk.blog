I&#8217;m what a lot of people call self-employed (or what my dad calls unemployed), some other people call being a &#8220;solopreneur&#8221; (without the slightest hint of irony). As a solopreneur, in addition to being able to use incredibly obnoxious words to describe myself, I have a lot of freedoms that I didn&#8217;t have when I worked for The Man. While some of them aren&#8217;t likely possibilities for those of you with more traditional jobs (like the frequent, rampant pantslessness), there are a lot of work habits I&#8217;ve developed that help me be productive that I highly recommend (like frequent, rampant pantslessness, but I digress).

When you&#8217;re never scorned for not working hard enough, or long enough, or emaily enough, you stop working in order to avoid being scorned. It took a while for me to unlearn this habit, but it was a huge weight off my back when it happened. The constant encumbrance of demonstrating I was working, in addition to working, really got in the way of producing good work.
