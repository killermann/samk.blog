I was reading a blog post someone wrote about me (I know. Let&#8217;s move on.) and they described me as &#8220;incredibly ambitious.&#8221; This was meant to be a compliment. Cool. Nice of you. But I don&#8217;t see it that way. I get upset when people describe me or think of me as ambitious. In general, I discourage ambition.

In many ways, ambition is the opposite of who I am, want to be, and what I want for others.

<!--more-->

Ambition can be <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ambition?s=t" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">defined</a> as &#8220;an earnest desire for some type of achievement or distinction, as power, honor, fame, or wealth, and the willingness to strive for its attainment,&#8221; but it can also be thought of simple as _wanting more_. 

We&#8217;re all encouraged to be ambitious. 

To work hard and be rewarded, to rise through the ranks, climb the corporate ladder; set your goals high, and if you accomplish them they weren&#8217;t high enough &#8212; set new goals higher. Work, fight, strive, reach, claw, get, more, more, more.<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><br /> </span>

I&#8217;ve spent a lot of my adult life unteaching myself all of that. 

I&#8217;ve tried to teach myself that <a title="My Minimalism Story" href="//minimalism-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enough is enough</a>. That Need trumps Want, and that I&#8217;m happier when I want <a title="100+ Tips for Minimalism" href="//minimalism-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what I need</a>. Teaching myself that awards and acknowledgments and titles are external validation that will never fill a void inside me if I don&#8217;t validate myself, and that the only hurdle I need to jump for that medal is to be the least encumbered _me_ I can be. I&#8217;ve tried to teach myself peace, contentedness, and <a title="Be Your Own Friend First" href="//be-your-own-friend-first/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">self love</a>. 

And I&#8217;m still unlearning. And I&#8217;m still learning. And when I&#8217;m described as ambitious, it helps clarify why.

## Ambitious ≠ Hard Working

I do work. I work hard. And I _do work_ hard. My computer is my dojo, and I train long and often. But working hard does not equal ambitious. 

I work hard because I enjoy working hard. Because I can. Because I don&#8217;t need much sleep, and prefer working when I&#8217;m awake over distraction. I like flexing my mind, not numbing it. I do selfless work selfishly.

I don&#8217;t work hard because I&#8217;m trying to become something; I don&#8217;t want to be anything but myself. 

I&#8217;m not working hard because I want to be awarded or recognized with some merit; I&#8217;m &#8220;Sam,&#8221; that&#8217;s the only way I want to be recognized. 

I&#8217;m not working hard to prepare for an early retirement, or investing now so I can later reap the crops of the seeds I&#8217;m sowing; I&#8217;m eating them as they germinate (they are delicious). 

I&#8217;m not climbing; I&#8217;m enjoying the view.

I&#8217;m doing my best. And I will forever do my best. And I encourage you to do the same. But I never want to do &#8220;better than my best&#8221; or some other stupid &#8216;inspirational&#8217; message you see on Facebook propogandizing ambition. 

I don&#8217;t want to want. And that&#8217;s what ambition is.

## Why I Discourage Ambition

There&#8217;s this quote from Hamlet that I quote all the time. It&#8217;s perfect for so many things, and it&#8217;s perfect for this:

> <div>
>   Why, she would hang on him
> </div>
> 
> <div>
>   As if increase of appetite had grown
> </div>
> 
> <div>
>   By what it fed on
> </div>

Ambition is a beast that can&#8217;t be fed. 

Collect one medal, and it won&#8217;t seem shiny when you see someone else with two. Collect two, and you&#8217;ll see how nicely the one complements the other, and crave a third. _You know, for a set_. A trophy case isn&#8217;t gonna be enough. You&#8217;re going to need a trophy room. And then you&#8217;re dead. And in all this medal earning and storing you never took a moment to sit down and hold one in your hands &#8212; just one medal &#8212; and reflect on what it means to you. 

And in your medal lust (awesome phrase) you never gave yourself the room or space to appreciate the quest.

I was talking with a big game trophy hunter recently (I know. Let&#8217;s move on.) and I asked him what he treasured more, the trophies (AKA dead animals scattered around his house) or the hunt (AKA hiding then surprise-killing those animals). 

He said something amazingly poignant, something he&#8217;d said plenty of times, but never realized how sad it was: &#8220;Well, when I&#8217;m on the hunt I think a lot about the trophies, and how great this thing will look [somewhere in my ghastly, dead-creature-filled house]. But when I&#8217;m at home, looking at them, I can&#8217;t help but think of the hunt. That&#8217;s why I keep going back out there.&#8221; 

Then he basically patted himself on his back. And so did I, but in a slower, more concerned way, because I realized (while he didn&#8217;t) how sad that all was. He was never not-wanting. Never contented. Never happy.

Ambition is always wanting what you can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t have. Contentedness is wanting what you have. One leads to true [happiness][1] and peace, the other leads to a life too busy to realize how [unhappy][2] and unpeaceful you are.

Pick yours. I&#8217;ve picked mine.
