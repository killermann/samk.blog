After that dramatic and self-exposing post <a title="Hiding Behind a Keyboard: The Terror of the Unknown" href="//hiding-behind-a-keyboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday</a>, there was no way this wasn&#8217;t going to happen. So here it is, folks: my first-ever podcast! And I only _kinda_ blacked out from nervousness while recording it. If you use Soundcloud, you can <a title="Sam Killermann on Soundcloud" href="http://soundcloud.com/killermann" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subscribe to me </a>there to get updates on future podcasts, or just subscribe to email updates here at the bottom of this page (I&#8217;ll be sharing all future podcast episodes here). I&#8217;ll look into making it and future episodes available on iTunes, and if anyone is well-versed in this [let me know][1].

I write a lot about the Platinum Rule in my book, _A Guide to Gender_, which you can get from <a title="Amazon!" href="amazon.com/The-Social-Justice-Advocates-Handbook/dp/0989760200/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a> or pay-what-you-want on the official site <a href="http://guidetogender.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">guidetogender.com</a>.

Huge thanks to Rustik Jamz for the music. Check them out: @[rustik-jamz][2].

Double huge thanks to Dr. Milton Bennett for coining the term &#8220;The Platinum Rule&#8221; back in 1979 and having such a huge impact on my life before I was even born.

_Oh, and that header image is taken from a Powerpoint I made for a keynote I gave recently, where I had comparison slides to visually depict the differences between the Golden Rule and the Platinum Rule. I made them on the plane en route. They might be my favorite things I&#8217;ve ever made. They are included  below for your viewing pleasure (:_
