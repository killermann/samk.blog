A couple months ago my friends <a href="http://www.unhushed.net/" target="_blank">Karen Rayne</a> and Heather Ross approached me with an idea. I don&#8217;t remember the wording, but I don&#8217;t think it was anything less tongue-in-cheek than &#8220;Wanna do a sex show in Austin?&#8221;

Um. Yes.

I&#8217;ve been wanting to find a way to bring what I do &#8212; the social justice comedy-ness of it all &#8212; to a more _adult_ crowd (if you will) for a couple years now. When I first moved to Austin the plan was to produce my show, _<a href="http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com" target="_blank">It&#8217;s Pronounced Metrosexual</a>, _in town as a standing gig, then take it on the road to colleges. That fell through for a ton of in-the-end beneficial reasons, and I ended up rewriting the show into what it is now: something that&#8217;s perfect for colleges, but not so perfect for ATX.

Enter <a href="http://haveyouseenSEX.com" target="_blank">S.E.X.</a>

The idea behind the show is that I get to tell a bunch of stories I rarely/never get to tell (like my orgy story, or this new one about a massage in Dahab), and Karen gets to answer questions that adults [in Texas, or, really, most places] have never been able to ask (like, &#8220;How does fisting _work?_&#8220;). And we&#8217;re doing it on stage.

It&#8217;s a perfect date night. Great for 20s, 30s, and 40+s couples, getting away from the kids, or just opening your mind to something new.

Every month, the show will have a different theme, and for the first one, it&#8217;s [obviously] Our First Time. It&#8217;s going to be a blast, an adventure, and a bit terrifying; awkward, clumsy, messy; I&#8217;m definitely not going to tell my parents about it &#8212; but above all it&#8217;s going to be perfectly _Austin._

Below is a little video we put together that might help make it all make sense. Further below is an interview I did with a [delightful person][1] that was _supposed to be_ about the show.
