I just got back from watching the new _Hunger Games _flick. I cried 15+ times in 146 minutes and left the theatre fired up to burn down the establishment. You should see it. I also went alone. And that&#8217;s not how you&#8217;re supposed to do that thing. But if you&#8217;ve never done it, do it. Even if just once.

It&#8217;s an important experience, even if it seems silly. Here&#8217;re my tips for making the most out of it.

  * The teller who sells you your ticket &#8220;for one&#8221; will give you a look like she&#8217;s never seen someone seen a movie alone. She has, she&#8217;s just having the same knee-jerk judgmental reaction to you being alone that your subconscious is having to you being alone: it&#8217;s wrong. Throw them both off with a big grin and by saying &#8220;Yep, just the one. I&#8217;m the one. No friends with me, no fam, not meeting anyone inside. I&#8217;m alone. All by myself. And I&#8217;m going to watch the sh*t out of this movie.&#8221;
  * Then get popcorn. Not because you&#8217;re alone, or for any special reason. Just because popcorn is awesome.
  * Get there early enough to get the absolute best seat in the theatre. About a third of the way up the main section, dead center, just you and your popcorn. You own that space. People are going to ask if you&#8217;re saving the seats beside you. You&#8217;re welcome to save one for your popcorn.
  * Everyone will start filtering in and the lights are on and they&#8217;ll all see you and you&#8217;ll start to feel like your own little _Truman Show. _You will be tempted to whip your phone out and keep your mind busy. Don&#8217;t do that. No! I said don&#8217;t. Turn on airplane mode and put it away. _Search your feelings, Luke_.
  * The lights will dim for the previews and you&#8217;ll start to feel anonymous. There will likely be some trailers for movies where they show all the super hilarious parts. This is when you&#8217;ll have two options: (1) sink into that anonymity in the dark, enjoy the movie in silence, and roll out, not particularly stoked; or (2) fulfill that promise to yourself and watch the sh*t out of this movie, starting by giving into the hilarity of the &#8220;show all the funny parts&#8221; movie trailers. LOL, but for reals.
  * The movie is about to start. Shhh!
  * Laugh, groan, shriek, and watch the sh*t out of the movie. If there&#8217;s one of those &#8220;nuh uh!&#8221; moments where you&#8217;d normally turn to your fellow movie goer and be all &#8220;nuh uhhh!&#8221; do that. Just, to a stranger. Or your popcorn. &#8220;That snack isn&#8217;t the best.&#8221; Nuh uhhhhh!
  * Every time you laugh, you&#8217;ll be more aware of your laughter than you&#8217;re generally aware of your laughter. This is great. _Give in to your anger. With each passing moment you make yourself more my servant _(sorry, Luke, that quote may not have worked here).
  * The movie is over! Congrats! Give your popcorn bucket a greasy high-five.
  * Don&#8217;t stick around through the entire credits or anyone else who sticks around through the entire credits will think you&#8217;re there to murder them. Haha! Kidding. We&#8217;re past that, aren&#8217;t we!
  * Hold the door for a few strangers on the way out. It&#8217;s polite.
  * Then write a Facebook status about the movie and leave out the part where you were alone and then add that in a comment and experience the judgment all over. But now you&#8217;re okay with that, aren&#8217;t you? <div id="fb-root">

  * Then go home and blog about it.

Boom. You just experienced some life. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed eating popcorn tonight.
