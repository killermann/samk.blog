I arrived in Dahab in the middle of the night, the Red Sea choppy with a half-moon floating above in its own sea of stars. Even at 2am, I could see the silhouette of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia set against the constellations.

I stood on the walking bridge near my hostel for more than a few minutes, watching the small waves lap the shore, listening to the gentle sounds, breathing the salty fresh air. A person walked by me on the bridge, &#8220;Perfect night,&#8221; he said with an accent I couldn&#8217;t place.

&#8220;Perfect night,&#8221; I replied.<!--more-->

I walked down the shore a ways and saw a large projecter screen on the roof of a bar playing the World Cup match, Russia facing South Korea. The sign for the bar was in cyrillic. Nobody was around, but I ventured in and found my way to the roof. On the roof was one person who was watching the match, he nodded at me, I nodded back, sat down, and took it in.

The match ended 1 &#8211; 1, which was fine, because I was only half watching. With the moon behind the screen, the sounds of the sea to my left, sitting on a zafu in the middle of the world, there was much more to take in.

I&#8217;ve been told dozens of times since I&#8217;ve been in Egypt that I need to visit Dahab. That I do. That I would love it. &#8220;The energy,&#8221; one person said, &#8220;you&#8217;ll really appreciate it.&#8221; Or maybe it was the vibe. And the atmosphere. And &#8220;the people.&#8221; And all of those other hard-to-place sensations that some places are ripe with, and I was promised that this was a place that had those in spades.

I&#8217;ll be the first to say that I&#8217;m a person who buys into all of that wholesale. If you&#8217;ve read much of what I&#8217;ve written on this site, that&#8217;s no surprise. And in just an hour here, I&#8217;m already sold.

Walking slowly back along the shore, I passed another late night stroller. &#8220;Perfect night,&#8221; she said with an accent I couldn&#8217;t place.

&#8220;Perfect night,&#8221; I replied.
