I ride the bus.
  
I ride the bus because it&#8217;s good for the environment
  
& it makes for a smaller carbon footprint
  
& it helps me afford my month-to-month rent
  
But truly none of that is it.

I try to ride every day
  
Because it&#8217;s the slowest f-ing way
  
To get from point A
  
to point B
  
& slowness is good for me.
  
Never ride the bus if you&#8217;re in a hurry.
  
I ride because it gives me time to connect with me.
  
It&#8217;s on the bus my mind wanders free
  
Indulging every thought I have, however unnecessary
  
Because finding time for the unnecessary is necessary.

I ride the bus because it puts me beside
  
A stranger, a group of strangers, if just for one ride.
  
We are people who live in circles so distant
  
That we may have no other commonality significant
  
& would never see one another&#8217;s face
  
If not for the bus, our one common space.
  
It reminds me that we all coexist
  
A thought that&#8217;s too often too easily dismissed.

I ride the bus because everything is moving too fast
  
& riding reminds me of our communal past
  
Where we leaned on our neighbor
  
& had faith in strangers
  
& saw health for all as a worthwhile labor.
  
Before the Internet, cell phones, Facebook & Twitter
  
Diluted friendships to meaningless chatter.

I&#8217;m happy I found the bus
  
& believe I&#8217;m privileged to ride.
  
In the past three years without a car
  
Just the bus & my bike
  
I can only imagine how much of an impact it&#8217;s made.
  
My work has benefitted as much as my soul
  
As each day I take time, am mindful, & appreciate people.
