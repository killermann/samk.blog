  - NOM, if you wanna "talk shit," just talk shit. Your platform is confusing and self-contradictory enough. You can at least be clear about what you mean when you call a stranger out on the internet.

Hey NOM,

Sam Killermann here. Or, as I&#8217;m being described on your <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NationForMarriage/posts/394810763986898" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a>, &#8220;Sin with Colored Pencils&#8221; here. I read the &#8220;<a title="Gourmet Craziness" href="http://www.donotlink.com/cRM" target="_blank">blog post</a>&#8221; you wrote about me and my &#8220;Genderbread Person.&#8221; To be &#8220;honest,&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t put together exactly what you were &#8220;trying&#8221; to say. But I know you, you &#8220;know&#8221; me, I know me, and we both know it was meant to be a &#8220;hate&#8221; piece.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">(To others reading: sorry for all the confusing and unnecessary quotation marks. I&#8217;m trying to speak NOM&#8217;s language, because it&#8217;s important to me that this message gets through.)</span>

Y&#8217;all, we need to talk. You&#8217;re a terrible organization and you stand for terrible things and I hate you. See how clear that is? Speaking of which, first on the block, let&#8217;s clear up just how inept your wholly-unprovoked attack on me was.

## Gourmet Craziness: My Recipe for How To Effectively Talk Trash

Other than the title &#8220;<a href="http://www.donotlink.com/cRM" target="_blank">Gourmet Craziness: The &#8216;Genderbread Person 2.0</a>&#8216;&#8221; (which was clearly offensive on multiple levels &#8212; congrats) your entire blog post is an irreconcilable mess, like the first time I tried to make cookies and swapped the measurements for baking powder and sugar (people almost died). Clearly, you need a new recipe for Trash Talking. Allow me to help.

**_Ingredients:_**

  * 1 Thesis statement, derived from Jibberish Root
  * 1 Introduction
  * 1 Body
  * 1 Conclusion
  * Grammar and Syntax Rules, applied regularly
  * One Measure of Hyperbole (be sure to separate out the small heaping of oxymoron)
  * A Garnish of Humor, only if organic and locally available

**_Procedure:_**

Grind Jibberish Root until Thesis is present in pure, unalterated form. Combine with Introduction and add to Essay. Add Body and Conclusion and bring to a chatter on low heat over Peer Feedback, constantly mixing in Grammar and Syntax Rules. Before Essay begins to solidify, fold in the measure of Hyperbole, and garnish with Humor (but only if organic &#8212; chemically synthesized Humor will taint the dish, and is best left out).

Serves one Punk. (_But you do not, under any circumstances, utter &#8220;You got served, Punk!&#8221;)_

## I can imagine how desperate it must feel writing blog posts aboard a sinking ship.

You&#8217;re like that band in _The Titanic_, but instead of playing beautiful music while a bunch of people die meaninglessly, you&#8217;re meaninglessly screeching while drowning yourselves in 3-foot deep water. This is not a time of desperation. Your life doesn&#8217;t have to end. Just stand up on your own two feet, instead of constantly trying to support yourself upon imaginary platforms like &#8220;this is about families&#8221; and &#8220;civilization is going to end if&#8230;&#8221; Plant your feet on the ground with the honest and understandable &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid of what I don&#8217;t understand&#8221; and the rest of us will be happy to help.

You don&#8217;t have to drown, and your tantrum in the shore break isn&#8217;t going to slow the current from moving in the direction it&#8217;s always moved: forward.

BUT WHY IN THE HELL ARE YOU PICKING A FIGHT WITH ME? Are you that desperate? Actually, screw that. Say what you want about me, but don&#8217;t you **dare** insult the Genderbread Person. The Genderbread Person has done _nothing _to you, is bigger than me or you, has saved lives, and has existed longer in some form or fashion than either of us have as competing organizations (your goal of being a force for horribleness and ignorance; my goal of people not being assholes to each other); and it will exist long after your ship has sunk and (in response to the stress of this life I&#8217;ve chosen) I&#8217;ve developed a relationship with a Volleyball after stranding myself on a beach somewhere.

I <a href="https://twitter.com/NOMupdate/status/421709039324893184" target="_blank">read</a> that you just updated your website? Seriously? That&#8217;s like putting rims and a spoiler on a Chevy Nova that&#8217;s on cinderblocks. Get it? Because &#8220;Nova&#8221; is spanish for &#8220;F*ck You.&#8221; (Now that&#8217;s how you talk trash). But in all seriousness, your new website is garbage. I hope you paid a lot for it. WWJD? Donate to the <a href="http://www.thetrevorproject.org" target="_blank">Trevor Project</a> because their site has a salient mission and is actively promoting good in the world. (Trash. Talked).

## But I can&#8217;t imagine being as desperate as you&#8217;ve become.

Guess what. I&#8217;m from Indiana. I went to high school and college there. Let me give you a bit of advice, one former Hoosier to an organization currently campaigning in the Hoosier State: if you&#8217;re <a href="https://twitter.com/NOMupdate/status/422050306856611840" target="_blank">struggling to get people in <strong>Indiana</strong> to oppose marriage</a> equality, the war is over. Don&#8217;t think of Indiana as another battle in your War for Hate in 50 States™. It&#8217;s over. It&#8217;s done. Pack it up, y&#8217;all._
  
_ 

But I know you know that, or you wouldn&#8217;t&#8217;ve redirected your hate-spewing at a whole new vulnerable, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michelangelo-signorile/national-organization-for-marriage-trans-bashing_b_4255536.html" target="_blank">oppressed group of people</a>. And that&#8217;s where the Genderbread Person comes in, an innocent bystander in your misdirected campaign against the trans* population, yet another marginalized and misunderstood personhood you can vilify and manipulate to coerce Fear Dollars™ from ignorant, exploited Middle Americans.

Hell, your very first move, naming yourselves the &#8220;National Organization for Marriage&#8221; was an act of desperation, already smelling that &#8220;National Organization for Hate&#8221; or &#8220;National Organization for Putting Our Noses Into Other People&#8217;s Business&#8221; is too rotten. Knowing that the majority of Americans stand behind their loved ones, friends, and family, even if they happened to have been born into a gender or sexual minority. You were born (actually, I think &#8220;spawned&#8221; is a better term) in desperation &#8212; &#8220;Who would stand against marriage? We&#8217;re so clever. Now let&#8217;s get to the oppressing!&#8221;

You know who ruined marriage? Straight people. You know who keeps making gay people? Straight people. Maybe same-sex marriage is the inoculation marriage needs against an ever-spreading plague of divorce. The Lord works in mysterious ways.

## NOM, if want to be in disbelief, disbelieve this.

The Genderbread Person is just the tip of the iceberg in my campaign to &#8220;indoctrinate&#8221; people in better understanding and relating to themselves and others. And it&#8217;s been gobbled up by hundreds of millions of people. _And_ I&#8217;m not the only person baking them.

But more than that, I wrote an <a href="http://guidetogender.com" target="_blank">entire book about gender</a>, and a lot of people are reading it. Like, a lot a lot. And people can get it for free (like a Bible in a hotel night table), which I bet freaks you out. It&#8217;s okay. Take a breath. You&#8217;re going to need it: I&#8217;ve been told by dozens of formerly anti &#8220;gender diversity&#8221; people that it opened their eyes to be more affirming and loving to people of all genders. Watch out.

And I gave a [TEDx talk about gender][1] that&#8217;s being watched _right now_ and shared by people who&#8217;ve been infected by its message: that people deserve to be understood, and that a core value of humanity should be doing whatever is in your power to make the individuals in your life feel unashamed of who they are.

What&#8217;s worse: I&#8217;m not the only one doing this, or who has these &#8220;radical&#8221; beliefs. Pretty much everyone I know (and I live in Texas, y&#8217;all) has jumped on the &#8220;treat people with basic decency&#8221; radical bandwagon, and when I&#8217;m on the road I hear from people of all walks of life about how they are working, struggling, and grinding to unlearn the prejudice groups like yours have poisoned our waters with in order to be more loving, sincere, and compassionate to the people in their lives.

Really, I think you have two options:

1. You can keep drowning in 3-foot deep waters, scraping money out of the few blue pills left whose minds We haven&#8217;t freed; or

2. You can start living the Christian values you espouse by loving more, judging less, and living in a way that serves others (instead of your outmoded, stubborn, vile egos).

I meant it when I said the rest of us are here for you if you need our help. Just ask.

Yours in unconditional love and peace,

Sam &#8220;Sin with Colored Pencils&#8221; Killermann

P.S. I didn&#8217;t want this, but if you wanna keep this tête-à-tête going, I&#8217;m not going to back down. I&#8217;m a quick, passionate, socially-conscious comedian with no day job and an internet at my disposal. You&#8217;re a bully with a dead cause. I don&#8217;t see this ending well for you.

  <strong><em>A Few Corrections From Your Article, NOM:</em></strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  My name has two Ns. Killerman<strong>n. </strong>It&#8217;s German, it&#8217;s not just the combination of the English words &#8220;Killer&#8221; and &#8220;Man.&#8221; That&#8217;d be terrifying. In German, it means &#8220;one who kills men.&#8221;<b><br /> </b>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  And my <a href="http://metrosam.com" target="_blank">show</a> doesn&#8217;t &#8220;implicitly paint Christians and &#8216;cisgender&#8217; persons as oblivious bullies.&#8221; Ironically, it&#8217;s about snap judgments (i.e., what your blog post about me is laden with), identity, and oppression. It&#8217;s not anti-Christian at all, other than the fact that I do denounce the Golden Rule (in lieu of the much shinier <a href="http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2011/12/the-corruption-of-the-golden-rule/" target="_blank">Platinum Rule</a>). I would argue that what I advocate in the show is incredibly Christian: love your neighbor, abstain from judgment, live a selfless life focused on helping others. Maybe you should see it sometime. I&#8217;d be happy to perform it free for you and yours.
