When I first started this project several months ago, I was [pretty clear][1] about what my goal was with the writing here: in short, nothing.

I wanted a space to explore new ideas, to reflect, to write, to share, but without any particular &#8220;goal.&#8221; So much of the writing I do is extremely goal-oriented. I wanted to see what would happen if I created a space that was less structured. I wasn&#8217;t sure what I&#8217;d end up writing about, what shape this site would take, and was happy to follow my fingers on an adventure.

And it was fun. I wrote a lot of things I&#8217;d&#8217;ve never written otherwise, found that I have thoughts about seemingly random things that others find value in reading. I only got a few pieces of hatemail compared to a pile of encouragemail &#8212; this was new. I started with only one real rule, but I broke it after about 100 days. I was planning on writing once a day, and when I started traveling a lot at the beginning of this year, I missed one day. And that&#8217;s the funny thing about [habits][2] &#8212; one missed day is alarmingly similar to one missed month, then you&#8217;re only a hop & skip away from a _never happening again ever._

After missing a few days, I experienced stress related to this project that I hadn&#8217;t experienced, and decided that it was time to take a break from it, reflect, and see if it still has a healthy place in my life. I&#8217;ve done that now, and I&#8217;m happy to say that it does. _Kinda._

Gone is _Sam Killermann&#8217;s Thought / Day_. Welcome _Dear World, _a much more fitting title for what&#8217;s going to be happening here.<!--more-->

## Say Hello to _Dear World_

From now on, think of everything I publish here to be a nudge &#8212; an open letter from me to the world at large. Whether it&#8217;s a nudge toward some new thing, a new way of thinking of an old thing, a good habit to add to your life, a bad habit to drop, or simply toward being a slightly happier person in this particular moment. A lot of what I&#8217;ve already written here was exactly this (and I&#8217;m not just talking about the [challenges][3]), and now that I&#8217;m not pressuring myself to write every day, I&#8217;ll be able to abstain when I don&#8217;t feel up to nudging.

I&#8217;ll be making updates to the site design itself to reflect this change, and will start writing here again as soon as I have something bouncing around in my brain worth sharing.

It&#8217;s my hope that writing this site will help me continue to challenge myself to live a healthier life, be a better human to other humans, and find clarity in the chaos. Any value it provides to you is bonus.

For those of you who have been missing Thought/Day, I appreciate your patience and encouragement.

Nudgingly yours,

sK
