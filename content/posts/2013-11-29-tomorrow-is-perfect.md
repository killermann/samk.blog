  “I have no faith in human perfectibility. I think that human exertion will have no appreciable effect upon humanity. Man is now only more active - not more happy - nor more wise, than he was 6000 years ago.”

I spent most of the day today horizontal. I slept a lot, napped a bit, and snoozed when I wasn&#8217;t doing one of those two things. Yesterday was the exact opposite. I was vertical, doing, and doing some more. Both days have been perfect.

I&#8217;m not sure what is in store for me tomorrow, whether I&#8217;ll be horizontal, vertical, or some other -al. I don&#8217;t know what to expect, and I always try my best _not to_ expect. [I prefer wondering][1] over knowing. But I do know one thing: tomorrow will be perfect.
