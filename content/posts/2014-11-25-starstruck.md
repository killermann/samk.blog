I would have replied, but I didn&#8217;t know my voice would be so hard to find. _You don&#8217;t get starstruck_, I kept telling myself, but maybe I&#8217;d never seen a real star. She felt like a star. A sparkling, ancient light, as beautiful as it is mysterious, sincere but distant.

I knew that I was going to hand her my book and explain why I needed to see her, what she symbolized to me, the support she&#8217;d offered without even knowing it. The new best friend who pops into your life right when you need them.

Sincerity is contagious.

I knew I was going to ask her to sign the passage in her book that struck me the hardest. Cut me deep and allowed me to bleed. I wanted to bleed. I was going to tell her that she let me bleed.

Sometimes it helps to hurt.

But I didn&#8217;t know that I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to say words. Or connect dots. _She talked about dots_, I thought to myself. _She knows about the dots. Creativity, art, doing art &#8212; it&#8217;s all about connected dots. Why am I thinking this? She knows this. I read it in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">her</span> book. Focus_.

&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;I&#8230; I don&#8217;t often know how to handle it. I&#8217;ve considered stopping &#8212; just&#8230; stopping &#8212; more in the past year than I did in the previous five combined. Thank&#8230; you. Thank you. For this. For you. I&#8211;&#8221;

&#8220;Don&#8217;t stop fighting,&#8221; she said. I felt the words.

She leaned her head on my shoulder, kissed me on the cheek. I felt like a child. That we were both children. I felt like I didn&#8217;t know how to feel.

I felt naïve and confident and terrified and coddled and right. I felt right. I felt like a child.

We were sitting on the playground together. I was the new kid; it was her turf. But I was used to being the new kid. I always landed myself in places I didn&#8217;t belong. As a kid, I moved around a lot, but more than that I made spaces up. I created places that I saw fit. As an adult, a lot of my life revolves around creating and occupying spaces that didn&#8217;t before exist, at least not for long. It&#8217;s lonely work.

I didn&#8217;t feel alone in that moment.

&#8220;I won&#8217;t stop,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;Please&#8230; just&#8230; please keep being you.&#8221;

I ran away.

I didn&#8217;t know how to say goodbye. I couldn&#8217;t make words. I hadn&#8217;t been that close to a star before. I panicked, a beautiful trainwreck, I got lost on the way out of the bookstore and found myself here, in a bar down the street writing this, because I needed to put these words down. To cherish this moment. To make sure it was real.

It was real.
