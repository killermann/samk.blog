What do you do?

No matter your answer, if you&#8217;re anything like me you probably have an iceberg-esque situation on your hands, with 10% of your time spent doing what you do and 90% of your time doing maintenance to allow that 10% to happen.

I&#8217;m a &#8220;social justice comedian.&#8221; Tonight, I got to do that. I performed my show at St. Martin&#8217;s University in Olympia, Washington. It was a blast. During that hour, I remembered, for the first time in too long, what I do. Because the vast (vast!) majority of my time as a social justice comedian is spent not being a social justice comedian.

The 10%/90% split is ambitious. Last year, only roughly .006% of the time I spent working was me onstage. The other 99.994% of the time I was reading emails, writing, writing emails, meeting, reading emails, traveling, designing, coding, and writing email. Now, in my case, I don&#8217;t _need_ to spend most of that time in those ways. In fact, most of the work I do actually gets in the way of me being able to do what I do. But even if I was just focusing completely on my show, I wouldn&#8217;t be spending the majority of my time on stage.

When I&#8217;ve gone a long time between performing my show, I get depressed, and find it harder and harder to do the 99.994%-type work I do. It&#8217;s easy to lose site of the forest for the trees, and to forget that every email I read and send, every article I write, every little promo thing I design &#8212; all of them are little steps that get me to my next time on stage. If I can find the joy on those things that I find in performing my show, my life will become the kind of dream that right now only ZzzQuil can induce.

I&#8217;m going to start trying to remember what I do while doing everything I do.
