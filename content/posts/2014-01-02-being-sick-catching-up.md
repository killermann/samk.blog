I don&#8217;t often get sick, but when I do, I get _sick_. While I was in New Orleans I came down with a wicked case of Swamp Flu. Or maybe it&#8217;s the Bayou Bug. I just hope it&#8217;s not Crawfish Sickness. I also hope I&#8217;m not offending my Nawlins friends with my silly imaginary NOLA illnesses. And the overall body sadness I&#8217;m experiencing right now is anything but imaginary.

There&#8217;s not much good that comes from chills and fevers and bears (oh my!), but it can be a nice time to play catch up on things in life that otherwise don&#8217;t get much attention. For me, that&#8217;s reading fiction and watching new television shows. Two things I&#8217;ve done a lot of today, and will likely (but hopefully not) do a bit more of tomorrow.

Now please excuse me while I simultaneously sweat and shiver. Oh, Body, how you amaze me so.
