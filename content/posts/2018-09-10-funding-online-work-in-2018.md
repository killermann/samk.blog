I wrote [an unusual blog post][1] (and designed an accompanying infographic) on my main site, _It&#8217;s Pronounced Metrosexual_, where I disclosed the numbers on the number of people who have contributed to the site, and the number who hasn&#8217;t. 

It&#8217;s reflective of all of my work, and an interesting (I think) take on the reality of creating stuff for the internet.
