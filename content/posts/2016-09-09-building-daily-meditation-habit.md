About a year ago I committed to writing on this site every day for 100 days in a row. Today, I&#8217;m committing to something similar and different: I&#8217;m going to start meditating every day, for at least the next 100.

Let me explain why, and how I plan to do it.

I&#8217;ve had an inconsistent meditation practice for about a decade now. At its best, I meditate every day for a streak of a week or two. At its worst, I meditate once a month.

But here&#8217;s the thing: I know that meditation makes me happier, calmer, work better, think clearer &#8212; it makes me _better._ Every time. I can even verify this for myself with some [obviously slanted] data: looking back at my journal, and comparing that against the records from the meditation app I use (Calm), I can see that on days I meditate I almost always finish every task I set out to do in the morning. I&#8217;m also more gracious, thoughtful, and patient in my responses.

On the days I don&#8217;t meditate, well, I get by, but I&#8217;m a bit messier. And sometimes those days turn into weeks into months. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s happened these past few weeks.

And the science backs this up, right? We all know this, if we exist even a little on the internet. Just google &#8220;[the scientific benefits of meditation][1]&#8221; and bask in the bazillion hits of glory.

## So, why don&#8217;t I do it every day?

Honestly, it&#8217;s hard to say. Up until today, I hadn&#8217;t really given it a lot of critical thought.

The best explanation that I&#8217;ve come up with is that it&#8217;s a habit that&#8217;s easy to avoid, _because _of how easy it is to keep. You can meditate anywhere. Any time. For as long (hours) or as short (one deep breath) as you want. I often meditate at home, but I&#8217;ll also do so in coffee shops, park benches, on trains and planes, etc., you get it &#8212; I&#8217;m turning into a Dr. Seuss book here (and Sam I am).

And because it&#8217;s so easy to meditate, it&#8217;s also easy _not to_. Because I can do it later. I can do it after breakfast, but right now I want to read this book. Or I&#8217;ll meditate when I get home, because this [project][2] isn&#8217;t going to launch itself. Then when I get home, I think _After dinner. Right now I&#8217;m on a roll cleaning. _And so on.

I&#8217;ve also never fully committed to a daily practice. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve entertained, and thought would be nice, and admired in other people&#8230; but not something I ever officially said I&#8217;m going to do myself.

I think the big reason why was that I didn&#8217;t want meditation to become a dreaded daily task, like reading emails, writing emails, or cleaning the food processor after making hummus.

## And how am I going to do it now?

For one, writing this post itself [I am banking on] is going to help me stick to the habit. I&#8217;ve read that making public pledges help us stick to our commitments, and I know from the experience of starting this blog that it works to motivate me.

So that&#8217;s one way: YOU all know I said I&#8217;m going to do this now, and YOU are going to hold me accountable? Right? YOU! Please do. Shoot me a [Facebook][3] message or [Tweet][4] whenever you&#8217;d like and encourage me. Especially if you&#8217;re trying to meditate more, because then I can encourage you back. Yay accountabillibuddies!

Beyond that, I have a few concrete things I&#8217;m going to start doing.

I&#8217;ve read [lots][5] of [other][6] [things][7] about habits. You might say I&#8217;ve successfully cultivated the habit of learning more things every day about how to maintain habits. That is both meta and sad.

From all that reading, I have decided upon the following:

  1. **I&#8217;m going to start small** by doing one minute meditations as part of this habit, and increase every week. Maybe I&#8217;ll sit longer as well, if I&#8217;m wanting to (I generally meditate for 15 &#8211; 30 minutes nowadays), but that will be _in addition to _the Unos.
  2. **I&#8217;m going to create the trigger** of meditating as soon as I <del>open my email*</del> unlock my phone in the morning. Email and/or news are often my first-thing-in-the-morning go-to (because I&#8217;m a masochist), and I&#8217;ve been trying to break that [bad] habit. So I&#8217;m going to replace it with meditation. Before I read my first email, and definitely before I respond to any emails.
  3. **I&#8217;m also going to create a few redundancies** to give me a second chance in case my trigger doesn&#8217;t work. I&#8217;m going to have my Calm app notify me once a day later in the morning, and I&#8217;m going to create a daily calendar event that checks in to see if I have meditated yet in the afternoon. And if I&#8217;ve already meditated, I&#8217;ll use those reminders to sit for longer, if I feel like it.
  4. **And I&#8217;m going to share my progress here.** One of the best motivators for me, _carte blanche_, is if I know a behavior I&#8217;m doing might help someone else. So if I write here about my struggles, little wins, lessons learned, and etc. &#8212; and they help other people trying to build a daily practice, then WIN WIN. This might be the most powerful of all my ideas. We&#8217;ll see.

This is more important to me than most of the other healthy habits I&#8217;ve either successfully cultivated (like standing daily for work) or attempted and failed (who needs pushups?). Fingers crossed that helps me make it happen.

I have a hard time imagining the impact of 100 days of straight meditation on my life, knowing what sitting for just a couple minutes can do for my day. I&#8217;m excited by the idea, and I&#8217;m going to hold it in my mind as I settle into this challenge.

***Updated** on day 2, because I realized I sometimes do news first, sometimes email &#8212; and neither are great
