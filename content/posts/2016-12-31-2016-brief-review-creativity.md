2016 was, well, _quite _the year.

All in all, I side with what appears to be the consensus that it was, if given only one descriptor, a dumpster fire. That said, it was also more than a dumpster fire, and I want to take a moment to reflect on some of the things I made this year &#8212; something I basically never do.

So, with that said, following is what I finished, published, and/or created in 2016.

## I launched a few new big projects.

[**hues**][1], the global justice collective that I co-founded and now houses me as an employee, was born. That&#8217;s no small cookie. Granted, it came out of the oven a little underdone, but that just makes for a gooey center, right?! </end cookie analogy> Hues was launched, but I also learned early that [hues would never be &#8220;launched,&#8221;][2] a perspective I carried into my other projects this year.

**[FacilitatingXYZ][3]**, a free online resource with videos, articles, and downloads for facilitators (and a collaboration with Meg Bolger, Kaleigh Conelison and lots of others), officially launched this year, after an abandoned Kickstarter and &#8220;back to the drawing board&#8221; period last year. Read more about that in [this blog post I wrote about it][4].

I jumped back into the webcomic game with **[Kinda Political Comics][5]**, where I doodled and wrote things during the horrendous campaign cycle. I&#8217;m planning on punching this up a notch in 2017, and publishing weekly updates.

I created two new sex education models, both collaborations with the wonderful [Dr. Karen Rayne][6]. One is the **[Sexualitree][7]**, a comprehensive model for understanding and teaching sexuality. I&#8217;ve heard that folks are using this in a lot of [wonderfully] unexpected ways, including a therapist who has adopted it for doing a personal history with their new clients. And the other is **[Columns & Shadows: A Healthy Relationship Model][8]**, that sex educators are using in classroom settings and sending me great texts/emails about. I think, generally, people underestimate how much work goes into things like these, both of which were in design/ideation phases, then testing phases, for many, many months. The sexualitree, for example, was a work in progress for two years, as exhibited by this early draft I posted on Instagram:

## I published one book, and wrote/re-wrote two others.

_[Unlocking the Magic of Facilitation: 11 Key Concepts You Didn&#8217;t Know You Didn&#8217;t Know][9]_, which I co-authored with Meg Bolger (Yes, same Meg as above), came out in January. It&#8217;s had a great year, with consistent sales and getting a lot of use at our [Safe Zone Train-the-Trainers][10].

I re-wrote _[A Guide to Gender][11], _prepping it for 2nd Edition release in 2017. Yay for 4-year-later updates on a concept that evolves every-freaking-day!

And I wrote an entire new book this fall (working title is &#8220;_Creastinate_&#8220;), which I&#8217;m keeping mostly a secret, but am planning to publish in 2017 (along with a new magazine that I&#8217;m hoping to launch, and have _mostly-ready-for-prying-eyes)._

## And I made so many websites.

I&#8217;ll start with my favorite, **[I <3 Singular They][12]**, an animated love letter to a pronoun. This site reached 250,000 people in its first month, and, while the espoused goal was never accomplished (reforming style guides by the end of 2016), I&#8217;d say the emails I&#8217;ve gotten thanking me (often from younglings who have used the site to advocate for themselves to their parents and teachers) mark a small victory.

**[The Sexualitree][13]** got its own website, that is the first of many of that genre: specific websites for free online resources. 2017 will see a [Genderbread][14] F.O.R.

A brand new collaborative project required a monster of a website: [**FacilitatingXYZ**][3]. That project was a massive undertaking that resulted in a happy outcome, with a mobile-friendly site that highlights lots of different types of content (articles, videos, downloads) from lots of different creators.

Two new websites for two new books: [**Unlocking the Magic of Facilitatio**n][9] (which came out in January) got an enchanting ground-up build, and I overhauled the **[A Guide to Gender][11]** website for the 2nd Edition (which will come out early spring 2017).

I made a speaking website for myself (or, really, for my manager, who kept asking me to build a speaking website), **[Samtalkto.us][15]**, last week, to replace what was essentially a domain-holder site that I had whipped together and never used.

I created the **[hues][1]** website to house all the wonderful works (and works-in-progress) that comprise our flagship organization, and it&#8217;s PACKED FULL OF COLOR.

And just today (hey, it counts!) I launched [**Open.hues**][16], a half-website, half-blog, half-social-network Frankenproject that will serve as my new platform for communication, both with other hues staff, and with the world-at-large (instead of email). This was really fun to make because I&#8217;ve always wanted to create a social network, and I&#8217;m going to have so a blast building out the functionality on this site over the next couple years, assuming the world doesn&#8217;t end.

Happy 2017.
