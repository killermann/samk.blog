It was a sunny afternoon, and we were sitting in our AirBnB house in the Nimman neighborhood of Chiang Mai City. The morning was spent eating (khao soi for me, with wontons) and lounging around the house, catching up on e-tasks from life back home. We were recovering from a marathon evening of music video shooting the night before. With no plans for the rest of the day, I turned to Chris and asked, &#8220;Want to rent motorcycles?&#8221;

I used to have a motorcyle. It was a long time ago. Chris has never ridden a motorcycle (but he&#8217;s ridden a four-wheeler and knows how to drive a stick shift, he assures me &#8212; _That should translate_, I think).

&#8220;Yes.&#8221; In one word, our afternoon went from lounging to adventure.

We started googling. Searching things like &#8220;How to rent a motorcycle in Thailand&#8221; and &#8220;is it a good idea to rent a motorcycle in Thailand&#8221; and &#8220;tourist disasters dead scammed from renting motorcycles in Thailand?&#8221; The best thing I found was a post from 2009 where the advised that some moped rental places were known to steal their own bikes back from renters, then charge them the replacement fee. 

Inauspicious.

We found Bikky Motorcycle rentals in Chiang Mai, where they have what resembles an Ebay shopping layout for motorcycle rentals.

&#8220;It can&#8217;t be this easy,&#8221; we laugh. There&#8217;s no way we just add a motorcycle to our cart, give them a credit card, and are driving it around a foreign country with mysterious traffic laws and no drivers credentials (let alone motorcycle knowhow / licenses).

After a couple phonecalls, we learn it&#8217;s actually easier. 

&#8220;They&#8217;ll be there in 15 minutes,&#8221; they tell Chris.
