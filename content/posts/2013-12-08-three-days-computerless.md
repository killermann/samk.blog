excerpt: |
  "Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the overcompensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn't nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand."

I should have m[y computer back][1] tomorrow. Living without it these past few days has been odd, in some ways more expected than others.

  * I&#8217;ve realized how generally worthless I am to the world without a computer to mash myself through, like how you mash flour and water through a pasta press then voila! We&#8217;re family!
  * I got sick. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s because I didn&#8217;t have a computer. But I also don&#8217;t get sick very often, so&#8230;
  * I&#8217;ve read a lot. Way more than usual. Two books made of paper and tons of other smaller things. That was nice.
  * Though it&#8217;s terribly cumbersome, I&#8217;m able to fashion an entire post on this site with nothing more than my phone, from drafting to image making to publishing.
  * That last one freaks me out a bit, but mostly excites me.
  * It&#8217;s always the times when you don&#8217;t think you can take a moment to sharpen your saw that your saw needs sharpening most.

I&#8217;m looking forward to getting my replacement computer / work station / cuddle friend in the mail tomorrow. I have a LOT of flour and water stirring around that I&#8217;m stoked to smush into it.
