There&#8217;s an epidemic happening, people. It&#8217;s in my Facebook newsfeed and my Twitter tweetsfeed and my Google+ hahakiddingIdon&#8217;tcheckthatfeed. I believe it&#8217;s evolved from the fairly harmless confusion of their/they&#8217;re/there into the now dangerous misuse of &#8220;proud&#8221; and &#8220;humbled.&#8221;

The short version: people are saying they&#8217;re &#8220;proud&#8221; when they are really affirmingly excited, and they&#8217;re saying they&#8217;re &#8220;humbled&#8221; when they are really proud.

## The Longer Version

I&#8217;m not going to call people out directly, because I don&#8217;t want them to feel like sad pandas. So instead of quotes (or screencaps, because I just saw several outbreaks of this plague, which led to this article), I&#8217;ll give you a couple broad reenactments of what I&#8217;m talking about.

### Opening Argument

People of the jury, honorable judge, and all you scumbags in the nosebleed seats: I am humbled to be here to have this opportunity to present this case, and will be proud of you knowing that, after I present the evidence, you will likely come to the conclusion that these words are being falsely represented all on your own.

### Exhibit A: The &#8220;Proud&#8221;

> &#8220;I&#8217;m so proud of [this group that did something cool / this person who did something cool / Smokey the Bear who, unlike you, prevented forest fires]. They&#8217;re so great.&#8221;

### **Exhibit B: The &#8220;Humbled&#8221;**

> &#8220;I&#8217;m so humbled that [this great thing has happened to me / I&#8217;ve accomplished or been recognized for this thing I did / I won an Emmy (I&#8217;ve got some bourgeois Facebook friends)].&#8221;

### Exhibit C: The &#8220;Proud&#8221; Definition

> 1. feeling pleasure or satisfaction over something regarded as highly honorable or creditable to oneself.
  
> 2. having, proceeding from, or showing a high opinion of one&#8217;s own dignity, importance, or superiority.
  
> 3. having or showing self-respect or self-esteem.
  
> 4. highly gratifying to the feelings or self-esteem: It was a proud day for him when his son entered college.
  
> 5. highly honorable or creditable: a proud achievement.

### Exhibit D: The &#8220;Humbled&#8221; Definition

> 1. to lower in condition, importance, or dignity; abase.
  
> 2. to destroy the independence, power, or will of.
  
> 3. to make meek: to humble one&#8217;s heart.

### Closing Argument

So as you can likely see, when people say they&#8217;re &#8220;proud&#8221; of someone else&#8217;s accomplishments, they&#8217;re really saying they are entitled to some honor or credit in the accomplishing of those accomplishments; and when people say they are &#8220;humbled&#8221; by other people recognizing them for their accomplishments, what they really mean is they&#8217;re proud of how awesome they are. Can I get an Amen?! \*Drops Bible\* \*Storms Out of Courtroom\*

Judge: &#8220;Why was he holding a Bible?&#8221;

## What&#8217;s the problem? Am I a Word Police?

The problem is that words mean things, and our misuse of words, or misconstruing the meaning, also means things. What we&#8217;re saying with the above two-punch combo of social-media-back-patting is:

  * This group/person did something worthy of back-patting. I want some of that back-patting, too. &#8220;Check out this awesome thing someone else did! <sub>It couldn&#8217;t have happened or you wouldn&#8217;t know about it without me.</sub>&#8220;
  * Ooo, I did something worthy of back-patting myself, but it&#8217;s vain and bad to be proud of myself. Oh, yeah, it&#8217;s good to be humble, I&#8217;ll use that word. &#8220;I&#8217;m humbled! <sub>By how awesome I am.</sub>&#8220;

We&#8217;re giving ourselves undue credit in other people&#8217;s accomplishments, while not fully crediting ourselves in our own. And all of this, I&#8217;m supposing, is because we&#8217;re conditioned in a society that reinforces buying into this paradox. We&#8217;re supposed to work hard and be special and be exceptional, but we&#8217;re supposed to be modest lest we be perceived as egotistical, vain, or &#8220;I bet you think of yourself when you masturbate.&#8221; Add to all of this a crippling desire to be externally validated for a sense of accomplishment (something we were trained to need by years of grades and ribbons and standardized tests and gold stars), the image-crafting of social media, and a society that creates and worships a small group of elite&#8230; and we have a lot of <a title="We Fabricate the Obstacles that Stand Between Us and Happiness" href="//we-fabricate-the-obstacles-to-happiness/" target="_blank">obstacles between us and happiness</a>.

### So what can do we do differently?

Say what you mean. If you think someone has done something awesome, applaud them for doing something awesome. You might even be &#8220;humbled&#8221; by what they&#8217;ve done. Cool. If you deserve credit for their accomplishment, you&#8217;re more than welcome to be proud of them.

If, on the other hand, you&#8217;ve done something awesome, and you want to be recognized, you&#8217;re also welcome to be proud. But you&#8217;re not humbled, and you&#8217;re ruining that word (it&#8217;s a powerful, important word), so stop using it. Let&#8217;s stop thinking that false modesty is preferred over legitimate pride.

Let&#8217;s affirm people in being proud of what they&#8217;ve accomplished, and do our best to subvert the discomfort people feel that leads them to being falsely modest. But, more importantly and bigger picture, let&#8217;s try to create a space for our friends and loved ones where they don&#8217;t need to seek external validation to be happy, where they don&#8217;t see accomplishment as a prerequisite for people to appreciate them, and where they feel unconditionally appreciated just for _being__. _We can start by fully <a title="Be Your Own Friend First" href="//be-your-own-friend-first/" target="_blank">learning this for ourselves</a>, and having an open heart with no minimum admission requirements.
