I lie a lot. I didn&#8217;t realize that until I started [following Sam Harris][1], the Author of <a title="Lying" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1940051002?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=1940051002&linkCode=xm2&tag=wwwsamharri02-20" target="_blank"><em>Lying</em></a>, on Twitter (I highly recommend following him, by the way &#8212; dude&#8217;s got a _great_ first name). A few days ago one of my Twitter buds retweeted his challenge below, which is how I was introduced to Sam (great name, by the way) and his work.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

Instead of pledging not to tell a lie, I decided to first just be cognizant of the lies I found myself telling. I wanted to see how terrible of a person I am before I decided to quit lying cold turkey for a week. And holy cow. If more lies make you a worse person, I&#8217;m Joker from _Dark Knight _bad. The _vast_ majority of the lies I heard myself telling were completely meaningless: they didn&#8217;t really benefit me in any way that telling the truth wouldn&#8217;t. It made no sense to me.

But I guess that some men just want to watch the world burn.

White lies, where I would find myself saying something untruthful for the perceived benefit of someone else, were also common. But, again, I can&#8217;t think of any case where I would&#8217;ve actually done the person harm by telling the truth.

Even the lies that were meaningful detours from the truth were not only completely unnecessary, but examples of me making a poor life choice. I&#8217;m not sure why I told them, because rational choice theory would make a clear argument against the lie. The tiny potential short-term benefit doesn&#8217;t come close to escaping the shadow of  _now I must uphold this lie forever_. But I told them nonetheless. Because who doesn&#8217;t enjoy crippling anxiety?

I found myself wondering, for the first time in my life (and am currently wondering again), how many lies I&#8217;ve told in my entire life. Or, even more worrisome, what the ratio of truths-to-lies is in my average day. This, my friends, is a rabbit hole I do not recommend. Take the blue pill, keep living your life, and thank me later, because it gets dark fast (not quite &#8220;why do I have electric plugs instead of nipples?&#8221; dark, but definitely &#8220;you think that&#8217;s air you&#8217;re breathing now?&#8221; kind of dark).  If you do wander down this twisting corridor, let me know when you get to the part where you start to wonder what _truth _really is, if anything you&#8217;ve ever known was true, and if perhaps the things you think are lies are actually facts and I&#8217;ve just been lying to myself and oh god my nose is bleeding.

So. Anyway. The title of this thought. I&#8217;m going to do that. For real. Starting now: (and I would love for you to do the same thing, then we can share our thoughts next week. You know, unless you&#8217;re an unscrupulous scumbag&#8230; like, well, me?) No lies for 168 hours. No white lies, no lying by omission, nada. Did you know it&#8217;s impossible to lie in question form? But I&#8217;m not even going to use that trick. It&#8217;s going to be tough, and I&#8217;m already anxious thinking about it, but for the next week I am not going to be dishonest at all.

Oh god my nose is bleeding.
