Edward Norton&#8217;s character in _Fight Club _introduced me to the term &#8220;single-serving friend,&#8221; a person who is your friend for a short period in time. In the movie, he&#8217;s talking about the people he meets on flights (&#8220;everything on a plane is single-serving&#8221;).

As someone who travels a lot, I&#8217;ve had the opportunities to make a lot of single-serving friends in the past few years. Sometimes it&#8217;s a few hours on a plane, and sometimes it&#8217;s a couple of days if I&#8217;m in a town for a conference or series of shows. For a long time I thought, like Norton&#8217;s character in _Fight Club_, that a single-serving friend was someone you only interacted with during that one short time period, greatly enjoyed one another&#8217;s company, then never saw each other again.

But that&#8217;s silly.

I&#8217;ve met some of the most fascinating, encouraging, inspirational, clever, and all-around sparkly people I may ever know when I&#8217;ve been traveling. To limit our connection to that hour, day, or week is more than a bummer &#8212; it&#8217;s life sabotage. &#8220;I really wish you lived here&#8221; is a common sentiment. Long distance relationships are hard, if not impossible. People have overfull lives. They don&#8217;t have room for a Sam from thousands of miles away. Or at least that&#8217;s how I thought of it for a long while.

I&#8217;ve changed the way that I think about single-serving friends.

Instead of viewing the friendship as single-serving, something that only exists for that one moment in time, I now think about that experience with that person as single-serving, with the hope and intent that we might have opportunities for future experiences together, even if they are similarly single-serving. We don&#8217;t need to maintain contact, be pen pals, or talk every day, but I like the idea of keeping the door (or inbox) open. This change has led to some really wonderful relationships, with folks near and far, that I deeply value. It&#8217;s also changed the way that I interact with folks on the road.

Knowing that I can have a meaningful single-serving friendship with someone means that I am more willing to have real conversations with people I meet on the road. Conversations about things that matter to them and to me, or to us &#8212; look at that: we just became an _us. _Instead of talking about the weather, or some stupid sports thing I don&#8217;t actually care about, we talk about life, in all of its wonderful fragments and facets. And talking about life, and hearing other people&#8217;s perspectives on life, helps me be better at life._

The possibility of a single-serving friendship also creates the possibility of real, meaningful connection to people I would have otherwise never allowed myself to connect to. And the more I connect, the more I want to connect. Connecting feels good. Wanting to connect more is a good habit to form. Connected life is a loving life.

If you&#8217;re digging the idea of single-serving friends, but aren&#8217;t sure where to start, or how to do it, here are a few humble tips:

  * **Be clear up front.** If you want to stay connected with someone, tell them. Ask if that&#8217;s okay. Explain what you mean.
  * **Don&#8217;t force it.** One of my best friends in the world is someone I only chat with or see a few times a year, but when we do, we&#8217;re immediately best friends again. That&#8217;s how our relationship works. It works that way because we&#8217;ve allowed it to be that way and haven&#8217;t tried to force it to be something it&#8217;s not. Feel it out.
  * **Hugs are good.** If you&#8217;re a hugger.
  * **Phone numbers are better than emails are better than Facebooks are better than Twitters. **Social media is a great way to _disconnect _from people. Let them tell you directly what they want to tell you about their life. Do the same.
  * **Be no-holds-barred honest.** We [all lie][1] more than we likely realize. Single-serving friendships can be amazing in that you have never told the person a lie (where most of the long-term or more high-contact friends you likely lie to inadvertently dozens of times a week). You don&#8217;t have to &#8220;protect&#8221; them with white lies, and you don&#8217;t need to puffer yourself into something you&#8217;re not. You can be blissfully, heart-relievingly honest. And it&#8217;s fantastic.
  * **High fives are good.** In case you&#8217;re not a hugger.
