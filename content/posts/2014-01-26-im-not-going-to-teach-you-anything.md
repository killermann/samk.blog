That&#8217;s something one of my professors in grad school would lead off with in the first class of the semester. The class was about the effect of environments on people&#8217;s ability to learn, develop, and grow. After sixteen weeks, hours of discussion, papers, and reading an entire textbook, he was right. Years later, it&#8217;s funny how much I find myself thinking the same thing as I approach my work.

So much of what I do &#8212; and what other folks who do work like mine do &#8212; is helping people rearrange the things they&#8217;ve already learned about themselves, their gender and sexuality, identity, and society. People have experienced the phenomena, they just don&#8217;t have names for them, or understand how they interlock or overlap.

It&#8217;s the difference between a personal shopper and a personal organizer. Instead of taking you to fancy stores to buy new fancy things, we spend a couple hours in your closet making sense of what you already have. Maybe you need a new pair of shoes, or a scarf to go with your favorite sweater, and I can help you with that, but for the most part I&#8217;m here to help you organize what you already have.

One of the challenges is finding ways to prevent people from recluttering everything as soon as you step away. While we&#8217;re chatting, the [Platinum Rule][1] might seem like a great idea, and everyone is all &#8220;heck yeah Imma do that.&#8221; Then two weeks later, they&#8217;re in some fight with some person and they think &#8220;that would have never pissed me off&#8221; and keep hammering away Golden-Rule style, mucking up their closet.

You can lead a fish to water, but you can&#8217;t make him eat a horse, ya know?

The other challenge is reassuring people that what they have in their closet is good enough. Gender, sexuality, identity, life &#8212; these are complicated ideas, and complicated ideas require complicated explanations utilizing complicated concepts, don&#8217;t they? Sometimes. But sometimes they don&#8217;t. And when someone already has all the tools to understand an idea but thinks they are missing something, it&#8217;s tough to convince them otherwise. And it&#8217;s tougher still to help them over the discomfort and fear of realizing how incompletely/incorrectly/disorganizedly they were viewing things their entire life up until that point. Sometimes it&#8217;s easier to to just say, &#8220;nope, not possible, don&#8217;t get it, let&#8217;s move on.&#8221;

Sometimes you bite off too much of a bitter pill to chew it, ya heard?

But the fun part of unteaching is seeing when it clicks. When a person, or group of people, realize something big, and realize that they&#8217;ve kinda known it all along. And knowing that it&#8217;s not going away. That part of their life is organized now.
