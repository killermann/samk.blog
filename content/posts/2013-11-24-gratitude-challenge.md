    Try as I might, I can't track down the actual photographer for today's photo for an actual credit, but <em><a href="http://zoomdoggle.com/2009/01/quick-whats-your-favorite-thing-about-today-thanks/" target="_blank">Zoomdoggle</a> </em>is the best I could do.

My momma taught me to say please and thank you, to keep my elbows off the table, and to never chew with my mouth full. As a near grown-up Sam, these all feel as natural as breathing, blinking, or eating peanut butter directly from the jar with a spoon (sorry, Momma).

I thank the bus driver whenever I get off the bus, the coffee shop person several times throughout the &#8220;put caffeine inside of me process&#8221; (&#8220;What would you like?&#8221; Caffeine, thanks!), and I even thanked the Capital One rep when she told me that my identity was stolen (again) and some yahoo in New York is spending all the money I don&#8217;t have. I say a lot of thank yous in any given day. But there are a lot of people I never thank.

I don&#8217;t thank the people who write essays (<a title="Deborah Tannen" href="http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/tannend/nyt062093.htm" target="_blank">like this one</a>) or give talks (<a title="Sam Richards" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sam_richards_a_radical_experiment_in_empathy.html" target="_blank">like this one</a>) that tickle my brain and leave my mind spinning for days, weeks, or, sometimes, years. I don&#8217;t thank the people who write <a title="Sway" href="http://www.amazon.com/Sway-Irresistible-Pull-Irrational-Behavior/dp/0385530609" target="_blank">books</a> <a title="Alchemist" href="http://www.amazon.com/Alchemist-Paulo-Coelho/dp/0061122416/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1385337409&sr=1-1&keywords=the+alchemist" target="_blank">I</a> <a title="Atwood, The Blind Assassin" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Blind-Assassin-A-Novel/dp/0385720955" target="_blank">read</a> that shape my perspective, changing the way I think about writing, the world, and myself. I don&#8217;t thank people who taught me things, or provided the support I needed, that led me to where I am today.

I got an email today from someone thanking me for the things I do online and it included the sentiment &#8220;I bet you get this a lot, but&#8230;&#8221; The truth is, I don&#8217;t get a lot of encouraging emails. In fact, I get very few. But the few I do get I stick in a Gmail folder called &#8220;encouragement&#8221; in case I&#8217;m having a rough week and need to tap into my reserves. Almost every encouraging email I _do _get includes that &#8220;I&#8217;m sure you get this a a lot&#8221; sentiment. And I realized today that I often think the same thing, and that keeps me from saying thank you to the people whose work I appreciate. _I don&#8217;t want to be a nuisance. They won&#8217;t care about hearing from lil ol&#8217; me._ _I&#8217;m gonna eat some more peanut butter from the jar._

If I can muster up the gratitude to say thanks to the bus driver, I can muster up a bit more to thank all those other people. I don&#8217;t mean to say bus drivers aren&#8217;t as worthy of my gratitude (they are!), but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m living up to the gratitude I was taught if I only say thanks to the people in my immediate presence. And I&#8217;m going to stop allowing myself to assume the other people, the writers and talkers and designers and creators, who influence me wouldn&#8217;t want to hear my thanks.

For the next week, whenever I read or watch something that really hits me deep, I&#8217;m going to write the person who made it a thank you. I will write at least one thank you per day for the next seven. Let me know if you&#8217;ll take the same challenge in the comments below, and we can share stories.

Thank you for being you,

sK

_Oh, but if you do, please don&#8217;t send me a thank you, or it won&#8217;t count as one of your seven (sorry, I don&#8217;t make the rules &#8212; blame the folks at corporate). This challenge is not me fishing for more thanks._
