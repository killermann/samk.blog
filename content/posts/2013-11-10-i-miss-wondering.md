Earlier tonight, I turned the burner on high and while I was waiting for my rice to come to a full boil I had a thought: &#8220;I wonder if rice cooked in beer would be good.&#8221;

A few years ago, I would have likely wondered that for quite a while. It may have been on my mind while I ate my boring water-based rice. It may have popped into my mind tomorrow, or the next day, when I next saw rice or beer. Visions of beer-based rice recipes might have danced in my belly. I may have wondered about it for a week (or ten) before I finally giving in, cooking it, and exiting Wonderland for Knowville.

But none of that happened, because Google.

Before the water (boring) in the pot began boiling I already knew if &#8220;beer rice&#8221; was a thing, what it would taste like (delicious), exactly how to make it, and what types of recipes it would be good in (ALL OF THEM).<!--more-->

This is a recent phenomenon that I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m comfortable with. It goes far beyond magical ways to cook rice. Earlier today I was wondering how long it would take to walk from Austin to San Francisco. This is a question my phone was able to answer in a few seconds (23.6 days of non-stop walking). Don&#8217;t get me wrong: it&#8217;s fantastic that I&#8217;m able to figure that out so quickly, because now I know that my idea for a project this summer is a bit less conceivable than I guessed. It&#8217;s great to know things sometimes. But it&#8217;s also nice to not know.

When you don&#8217;t know something, your mind wanders a bit and you might end up in a new space, or with a new thought, that you wouldn&#8217;t have had if you _knew_. Knowing can be dangerous, too, because while we might think we know something, and act on that knowledge, we rarely know anything. Only the Sith deal in absolutes.

And yes, I know that I can choose to not look something up, and let myself wonder a bit about it before I know, but that&#8217;s not the same. If the answer is right there at my finger tips, wondering feels insincere. I spent a great deal of my childhood wondering, but if I was able to google &#8220;Has anyone figured out if humans are able to hibernate like grizzly bears?&#8221; I would have. And then I would have been bummed. Because the answer is no. This is our future: we can look up anything that&#8217;s ever been known in a matter of seconds, but we don&#8217;t have flying cars and we have to stay awake all winter.

I love being able to learn as much as we&#8217;re able to learn on the internet. I _love_ love Wikipedia. But I also love the idea of not knowing, sometimes. And I miss that.

I miss wondering.
