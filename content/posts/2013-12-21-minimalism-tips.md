Kidding. 100 would be a bit excessive, and likely more than a bit counterintuitive, wouldn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s easy for us to be seduced by _a lot_, and to think that more is better, but we rarely need more than a little. More leads to wanting more; wanting more is insatiable. Like that Hamlet quote above &#8212; one of my all-time favs. More begets more.

[Minimalism][1] is [happiness][2]. Here&#8217;re all the tips you need for living minimally:

  * want less, focus on what you need more
  * <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">have less,Â appreciate what you have more</span>
  * do less, invest in what you do more
  * know less, wonder more
