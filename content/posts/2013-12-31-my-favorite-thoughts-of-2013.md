When I set out on this project, I was as clear as I could be about [what this is][1]. What it&#8217;s become, however, is one of my favorite parts of my day, every day for the past 62. While there is no goal to this project beyond to write more &#8212; nothing I&#8217;m trying to accomplish with the articles &#8212; there have been a few thoughts that have stuck out. Here are my favorite posts of [2013][2]:

### 10. [Let Your Teacher Grade Your Test][3]

### 9. [At What Point Do We Stop Thinking of Celebrities as People?][4]

### 8. [I’d be okay with a revolution.][5]

### 7. [Why I’m Glad Chivalry is Dead, From The Perspective of A Man Who Actually Likes Women][6]

### 6. [Being Alone Isn’t the Same as Being Lonely][7]

### 5. [The Abusive Relationship We’re All In That Most of Us Never Think About][8]

### 4. [Working to End Oppression Makes More Sense as a Republican Value than a Democratic One][9]

### 3. [Making a Bigger “Us” and a Smaller “Them”][10]

### 2. [We Fabricate the Obstacles that Stand Between Us and Happiness][11]

### 1. [The 3 Ingredients to a Happy Existence][12]

Happy 2013, Friends! I&#8217;m looking forward to what 2014 has in store for us.
