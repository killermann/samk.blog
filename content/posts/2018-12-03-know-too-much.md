I can tell you about things. Most days, I surprise myself by what I have crammed inside my noggin. I always surprise my friends. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just a hat rack, my friend&#8221; I joke regularly, when people give me blank-stared responses to the truly random things I know far too much about (just googled that phrase, curious where I picked it up: [an episode of Friends][1], I guess, I saw some 15 years ago).

My brain is a sponge, but a leaky sponge. I feel this burden to let it all out, to share it. It&#8217;s an onus. I share in different ways, hoping for the catharsis that it seems to promise. But it never delivers, it only increases the need. I&#8217;m reminded of a quote from Hamlet: &#8220;Why, she would hang on him, as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on.&#8221;

But moreso than leaky, my brain is a thirsty sponge. I feel this compulsion to take it all in. To read, to listen, to critically observe. As a kid, I used to read the dictionary and the encyclopedia. Now, I find myself obsessed with Wikipedia, and with hearing people&#8217;s stories. I watch TED talks voraciously. I&#8217;m struggling for a quote, then I find one of Blake&#8217;s _Proverbs of Hell_ &#8220;You never know what is enough until you know what is more than enough.&#8221;

[I spend an hour distracted from writing this, reading poetry on poets.org, starting with Blake&#8217;s _Proverbs of Hell_ in its entirety, several times through on each proverb, meditating on their meaning; I contemplate signing up for their poem a day, considering how I could write a reflection on each poem, a hope to share it with readers here who otherwise would not read the poems themselves. _Hell, I could reflect on each of Blake&#8217;s proverbs &#8212; many are profound! _I exclaim to myself before I start truly listening. I&#8217;m reminded of why I was writing this essay. In urgency, I return to it.]

Earlier tonight, I started to cry as I was reading through [a list of cognitive biases][2]. I was trying to remember the name of [a particular one][3], because I was going to use it as the fundament for an article I was writing and wanted to be able to appropriately source it (something that&#8217;s gotten harder and harder as I age &#8212; pinpointing where all the things in my sponge were acquired).

It wasn&#8217;t the list itself that led to my emotional breakdown (though that would be understandable, I think, considering its overwhelming implications), but that the particular social psychological phenomenon I was looking for wasn&#8217;t present. I hate the idea that an article on Wikipedia is incomplete, relative to my layperson, hobby awareness of cognitive biases. The list itself is overwhelming, the idea that I am able to add to it overwhelms me.

It&#8217;s also missing _commitment_, I message a friend. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to live on this planet any more,&#8221; I quote _Futurama_. I&#8217;ve watched all of the episodes of that show several times. I don&#8217;t understand how or why.

Later tonight (it&#8217;s 2am now) I&#8217;ll be laying in my bed, drinking red wine, reflecting on what led me to write all of this, hoping I can fall asleep before my meetings begin in the afternoon tomorrow, having known I wouldn&#8217;t publish this now, as I write it. I might publish it later, but for now it was enough to write it. The closest thing to catharsis. I often write for the sake of writing. That&#8217;s how it all started. It&#8217;s when I publish that the drive to create more is accelerated.

I&#8217;ll be laying there, thinking about everything I know and why I know it, and knowing &#8212; as I always know, _deeply _&#8212; how little purpose it serves for me to know any of it. Alone, everything I know only directs me toward knowing more clearly that which I don&#8217;t know: Everything. For every thing I think I&#8217;m more aware of how little I know about it, and how much less is known about it in general, as my thirst for knowing always leads me to dead ends and more questions than answers. This pursuit is perhaps the goal itself, but I know more than anything else how vain it is to go it alone, and how much its necessary to inspire others to deem it necessary, something I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t know how to do, nor may ever know how to do.

My fingers feel the keys. My eyes well with tears. The space bar is heavy, hard to push. I still mistype, wasting precious keystrokes. I wipe a tear from beneath my right eye, I dare not think of the future, or reflect on the past. I am now, and I refuse to be anything more.

&#8220;Think in the morning. Act in the noon. Eat in the evening. Sleep in the night.&#8221;
