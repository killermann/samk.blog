Christmas Time is a few days (or weeks, or months, at this point), when a lot of us change the ways we approach our life and the people in it. 

There are a lot of positive changes that are part of that shift, things that would likely make the rest of us our year a bit more merry if we were intentional about them all twelve months.

The first dictate in the [Code of Elves][1], after all, is &#8220;Treat every day like Christmas.&#8221; What would that look like if us humans raised by humans gave it a shot?

Here are some ways to treat every day like Christmas:

  1. **Focus on what you can give to others to make them happier.** And focus less on taking or giving to ourselves. Giving and making others happy will make you happy.
  2. **Be extremely grateful when a restaurant or store is open.** Be grateful they are allowing you to give them money for things you want. Don&#8217;t take it for granted. It&#8217;s a pretty sweet deal.
  3. **Sleep in a bit. **Snowflake pajamas or jazzy socks optional.
  4. **Cook more, and put your heart into it. **Microwave and order out less.
  5. **Spend time with people you care about. **Even if it takes a bit of work, or it&#8217;s cold, or you kinda-sometimes hate them, or they smell, or they&#8217;re a cotton-headed ninny muggins.
  6. **<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Drink wine. </strong>**<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">You know, for your heart health.</span>
  7. **Play.** With a kid. With yourself. Whichever. Just not both at the same time.
  8. **Open a present every morning with the enthusiasm of a four-year-old kid unwrapping a present**. Which present? How about _the _present? The gift of a new day! (Too corny? Really? C&#8217;mon. I thought that was pretttty clever &#8212; no? Okay, whatever, Grinch)
  9. **Find ways to laugh.** Even if you think a joke is corny. Stop being so damned bitter all the time. Yeah, I&#8217;m talking to you. Jerk.
 10. **Give more hugs.** Hugging makes the world better. Or, if it&#8217;s more your style, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Focus on what you can give to others to make them happier.
