Earlier tonight I gave the opening keynote for the [Nat&#8217;l Sex Ed Conference][1]. It was an hour that I&#8217;ve spent the last 6 months mulling, refining, trashing, rebuilding, trashing, reconceiving, and then, tonight, finally talking. I&#8217;ve never given a talk like that &#8212; not even close. And I mean that for more reasons than I can likely make sense here.

This year was wild.

I spent more time on the road this year than ever. I&#8217;ve been everywhere. I&#8217;m not sure if this is true (because I have a lot of accounting to d0), but I&#8217;m pretty sure I spent more money on travel (to do free talks, rep GAB, perform my show, etc.) this year than I _made_ in income last year. But my income was almost exactly the same. So I&#8217;ve finally lived some version of this phrase that&#8217;s been on IPM since I launched the site and my career: &#8220;Sam is committed to sharing this message as much as possible, and would much prefer performing the show at 50 schools a year instead of 15, even at the same wage.&#8221; I&#8217;ve given away thousands of copies of _a freaking book I wrote_. I wrote a book. I published a book. And tonight the CFLE sold a bunch at a table to raise funds, then folks wanted me to sign them. Real life. Not a single one would believe me when I said it was my privilege to have the opportunity to meet _them._ And the TED talk. I can&#8217;t believe that was this year.

I haven&#8217;t slept in 3 days. I haven&#8217;t rested in 12 months. I know it&#8217;s only December 11, but I spoke into a microphone for the last time of the year tonight, which is why I&#8217;m calling it over. _That part_ of my life is over for 2013.

And it all ended with words I&#8217;d never said out loud before, at the end of a talk that was almost entirely things I&#8217;d never said on stage, with a crowd standing and applauding. I didn&#8217;t even realize it was happening at first. I have a hard time acknowledging applause, so I was staring at the stage. When I looked up, everything came down. I felt 2013, all at once, the entire year, pass through me &#8212; or maybe that&#8217;s just the sleep deprivation.

I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m ready for 2014. But the good news is I have a couple weeks to prepare myself.
