I&#8217;m excited for Thailand. I&#8217;ve heard so many amazing things.

I&#8217;ve spoken with people who have immersed themselves in the culture, and had opportunities to reflect on things that were previously invisible in their lives. I know a couple people who have gone and never returned. That says a lot about a place.

I&#8217;ve talked with activists who are doing tremendous things in the worlds of gender liberation, sex worker advocacy, and social justice education. I&#8217;ve learned so much from them already, from afar, from email.<!--more-->

I have seen breathtaking photos of the national parks &#8212; the waterfalls, the foliage, the wildlife, the rainfall, the embodiments of peacefulness. They seem like the perfect place to hit reset after an already crazy year, and get my head back into an optimal place to tackle a full-travel-schedule Fall.

And the people, and the sacred sites, and the food. The food. I could have started and stopped with the food.

I&#8217;m excited.

I&#8217;m going for all of those things above, and for a few more.

I&#8217;m going to tag along with my favorite [#travelpop star][1] as he shoots some music videos and a documentary.

And I&#8217;m going to meet some people who will share their stories with me &#8212; stories I can incorporate into my work, to better represent them, their needs and wants, as I push for a healthier world.
