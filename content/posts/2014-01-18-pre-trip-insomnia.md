I&#8217;m flying to Seattle in a couple hours to speak at a conference for teen citizen lobbyists. Social justice advocate teen citizen lobbyists&#8230; pretty amazing, right?

As usual, I&#8217;m wide awake with no real hope of that changing. It&#8217;s been a few years now, and I haven&#8217;t outgrown this pre-trip insomnia. I really thought I would.

I&#8217;ve written [before][1] about how un-natural of a public speaker I am. When I started doing stand-up comedy, I would blackout from nervousness. While it sounds extreme, I&#8217;m not sure I would have ever kept going if I was cognizant of how terrible I was. Throughout the years, I&#8217;ve developed different pre-show practices that helped me cope with the anxiety. Until recently, I had to spend 5 &#8211; 10 minutes using the Kuji-In, or Kanji Mudra, hand meditation before hopping on stage, or there were no guarantees my head wouldn&#8217;t pop. Now I&#8217;m able to forego any pre-show rituals (though it&#8217;s not ideal) and I can actually pretend to not be super nervous and have a conversation with a human up until I take the stage. Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve developed this not so shiny pre-trip insomnia ritual.

The bigger the event, or the more meaningful it is to me, the more intense the insomnia. Before I keynoted the National Sex Ed Conference last month, I didn&#8217;t sleep for 3 nights in a row. I was up for 79 hours straight, spoke for one hour, socialized for four after, then slept hard enough that a gunshot wouldn&#8217;t&#8217;ve woken me up. And I don&#8217;t mean a gun randomly going off near me, I mean someone shooting me in the thigh.

Maybe in a year or two, or a few hundred more trips, I&#8217;ll shake this thing and be able to sleep the night before I hit the road. It&#8217;d be nice, but then when would I find time to rewatch seasons of _Futurama_?
