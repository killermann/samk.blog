I hadn&#8217;t really heard much about _About Time_, the newest Love-Actually-Notting-Hill-Brit-Rom-Com-warm-fuzzy delight. And, to be honest, while I love watching feel-good movies (because they, you know, make me [feel good][1]), I don&#8217;t generally have high expectations for them. They tend to be rather empty.

This one is not.<!--more-->

It has all the empty, fun, let&#8217;s pretend this happens and love them as they love each other parts. And I loved them. As they loved each other. But it also has a fun plot device (the one-directional, only-in-your-own-lifetime time travel) that&#8217;s a bit different, and a bit peculiar, and adds a certain zest to the story. And without spoiling much, it also creates the conflict and serves as the climax and provides the resolution &#8212; one thing, ALL THE PARTS.

But more than the movie itself, I love the idea it suggests. An idea that I&#8217;ve been struggling with trying to articulate here in so many different posts. A thought about what happiness is and what contentedness is and how you can _get it _and how you can avoid not getting it. The way the movie does it is better than any of the words I&#8217;ve managed to conjure here, and it&#8217;s wrapped up in such a delightful package.

I recommend watching it. And I recommend living it once you do. I&#8217;ll be trying.

Worst case scenario: you get to enjoy two hours of Rachel McAdams and equally adorable yet completely unknown to me Domhnall Gleeson.
