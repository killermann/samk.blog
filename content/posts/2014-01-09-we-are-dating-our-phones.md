Yo. I just saw _Her._ It&#8217;s cray. It&#8217;s powerfully well-written and brings up a lot of thoughts about how we might relate to technology and one another in the future. But it also made me think a lot about how we relate to technology and one another right now. If you have a smart phone and you&#8217;ve seen _Her_, you&#8217;ve likely had a lot of these thoughts already.

It&#8217;s hard to convince myself that we&#8217;re not already dating our phones.<!--more-->

Our phones are with us when we eat, sleep, drink, and, in my case, shower (Playing me tunes. I like singing in the shower &#8212; shoot me.). They change the way we see the world, tell us about news and events, entertain us when we&#8217;re bored. We are attached at the hip (literally), notice when we&#8217;re not together, can&#8217;t spend a night without one another.

If we&#8217;re down, or feeling lonely, we turn to our phone and the little red numbers that it possesses to pick us up. And our brain gets a little shot of oxytocin, the same chemical it gets when we physically hug someone. Great.

Have you ever been out and had your phone drop below 10% battery life? Holy shit. That feeling is more intense than most of the emotions my real-life relationships evoke on a daily basis.

Now, I&#8217;ve never had sex with my phone. That&#8217;s true. We gotta draw the line somewhere. But I&#8217;m totally dating my phone.

And I&#8217;m thinking I might want to break things off before it gets too serious.
