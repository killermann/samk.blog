This is my MacBook. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">My MacBook is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">My MacBook, without me, is still pretty shiny. Without my MacBook, I am useless and not at all shiny and can&#8217;t watch Netflix in bed (which I love). I must type words into Pages. I must type words into email correctly or autocorrect may ruin my life. I must send that email before I receive another email or email overload may ruin my life. I will&#8230;</span><!--more-->

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">My MacBook and I know that what counts in this world is not the insane heat it generates in my lap, the fact that it is likely making me infertile, nor the smoke it sometimes makes when I leave it on all night under the blankets because I fell asleep watching Netflix. We know that it is the amount of Buzzfeed </span>lists we get distracted by<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> that count. We will browse&#8230;</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">My MacBook is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will push its buttons like a lover. I will learn its shortcuts, its hotkeys, its energy saver preferences, and its 15 Must-Have Productivity Boosting Apps of 2014. I will keep my MacBook charged and ready, even as I am </span>caffeinated<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> and ready. We will become part of each other, but not in a gross way. I promise not to put any of my parts inside of its parts. We will&#8230;</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Before the late Steve Jobs, I swear this creed. My MacBook and I are the downloaders of the Adobe Creative Suite. We are the masters of </span>teh interwebz<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">. We are the saviors of my career.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">So be it, until victory is Apple&#8217;s and there is no aluminum left unbrushed.</span>
