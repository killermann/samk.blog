I woke up this morning to my computer not working. It&#8217;s not been in great shape these past few months, and has occasionally tossed a surprise my way. It&#8217;s several years old, and I&#8217;ve put it through plenty of hell with all my traveling (and general clumsiness). I&#8217;d already been investigating new options, and weighing the pros and cons. I knew its time was drawing near.

I have a lot of work on my plate right now, and a lot of it&#8217;s time sensitive. And chief thing on my mind is the Nat&#8217;l Sex Ed Conference next week, for which I&#8217;m excited to be one of the keynotes. I have a few pressing collaborations, plenty of more people who I&#8217;ve promised e-love to, and some big personal projects that are underway. Objectively, it&#8217;s not an ideal time for my computer to bail on me. But subjectively, I&#8217;m excited for a few days without my computer, amidst a few of the days this year I most crushingly want to feel like I _need _it.<!--more-->

This isn&#8217;t me finding the good in bad, or looking on the bright side, or making lemonade, or any of that hokum. I&#8217;m not jazzercising away the rage, or suffocating the feelings of &#8220;why me why now?&#8221; away with cheese. This isn&#8217;t some alternative reality I&#8217;m drafting to allow myself to enjoy my weekend.

This is good. It&#8217;s experiencing the brightness of that good. It&#8217;s the world handing me lemonade and me drinking it. There is no rage to jazzercize away, and no feelings of &#8220;why me why now?&#8221; for me to suffocate (though, don&#8217;t get me wrong, there still may be some cheese in the forecast). This is reality &#8212; [the only reality][1]. And in facing this reality, I could choose to be any of those things, but instead I&#8217;m choosing to have a wonderful weekend.

I haven&#8217;t had a weekend without my laptop since laptops were invented. I&#8217;m grateful to my roommate for lending me his computer to draft this thought, which allows me to keep up this unbroken chain. But I&#8217;m also grateful that my laptop broke &#8212; for I had a laptop to begin with, woke up this morning and was able to experience it being broken. And when my new laptop gets here next week, I&#8217;ll be grateful for that.

And, truthfully, I find the whole thing to be hilarious. I was cracking up as I was trying to turn my computer on this morning, realizing it wasn&#8217;t going to comply, and we were finally parting ways&#8230; right now, this weekend, when else? Life is the funniest comedian.

I was feeling incredibly grateful today, all day, huddled up in my blanket cocoon on my couch enjoying a quiet day, watching new TED Talks. The talk below came on, and (as has so serendipitously happened many times since I started this project) it fit perfectly into what I was thinking today. So here ya go. This is why I&#8217;m happy that my computer is broken.
