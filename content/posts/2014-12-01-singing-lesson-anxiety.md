The lesson will be private. One-on-one. And the instructor, Mady, is, by all accounts, an incredibly delightful, non-intimidating person. I&#8217;ve performed on stages in front of 5000+ person crowds. I&#8217;ve spoken to hundreds of thousands of people around the US. I&#8217;ve done stand-up comedy on a stage in a country where the material I was performing could have landed me in jail, or worse.

So why am I so nervous about this?

**It&#8217;s hard to ask for help.** I&#8217;ve been taught not to. I&#8217;ve been told as long as I&#8217;ve been able to be told things that the last thing I should ask for is help. Part of this I can blame on my gender, and the expectations I&#8217;ve been led to accept because of it, and part of it is a purely American &#8220;pull yourself up by your bootstraps&#8221; mentality I&#8217;ve internalized. Part of it is also likely just plain _me_-ness. Regardless of where it&#8217;s coming from, it&#8217;s here. And it&#8217;s loud.

**Because I have to admit I&#8217;m bad at something. **I wouldn&#8217;t need help if I was good enough, right? I&#8217;m good at a bunch of other things, so it would be way easier to just focus on those and not admit that I&#8217;m a disaster at this, right? And I know this from experience, because a few weeks ago in [my new show][1] I tried to sing a song I wrote for it, and it was, well, a hilarious disaster (not the intention, but hey &#8212; I rolled with it. Maybe I&#8217;ll post the footage someday, but maybe not, because&#8230;).

**And that makes me feel vulnerable. **And that&#8217;s terrifying. The idea of exposing myself, even just to one person (not like _that _&#8212; hell, that&#8217;d be easier than this), is more terrifying than getting up on stage in front of thousands doing something I know I can do. I have armor for that. Here, I not only don&#8217;t have armor, I have open wounds, and I&#8217;m going to be sitting in a room with a near-stranger pointing and poking at them.

This is entirely about singing, but it&#8217;s also entirely about anything. Anything that scares us so much we&#8217;d rather not acknowledge its existence. Anything we feel but refuse to see, to name. All of the [obstacles we create][2] that stand between us and a freer, less-encumbered us.

[Brene Brown][3], from afar, has helped support me in taking this leap, and all the other leaps I take. Amanda Palmer, in a [more direct, intimate way][4], has done the same. And even my soon-to-be-first-ever-singing-instructor has done a lot to make this easier:

I&#8217;m still terrified, but I stopped letting that stop me years ago.
