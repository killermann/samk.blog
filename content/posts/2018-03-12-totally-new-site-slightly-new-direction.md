Howdy! Today marks two turning points: the design of this site has changed (from [this][1] to [this][2]), and the name hasÂ changed (from &#8220;Dear World&#8221; to &#8220;Sam Killermann&#8217;s Blog&#8221;).

From here on, in addition to things I&#8217;ve been writing about before (like happiness & technology), I&#8217;ll also be writing about how I DIY (do it myself) in all things social good & online platform related, and posting more personal updates about my work/life.

And totally new: I&#8217;ll be creating [members-only content][3]! So ðŸ¤žto a new experiment.
