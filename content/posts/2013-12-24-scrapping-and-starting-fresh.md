A [couple months ago][1] I ventured into the land of the <a href="http://samkillermann.wpengine.com/category/voice/" target="_blank">podcast</a>. A couple weeks ago I roped my friend Ian in and &#8220;Thought of the Week&#8221; became &#8220;The Hawthorne Effect.&#8221; The whole thing has been a huge learning process. After doing a number of different podcast approaches by myself, and trying a few different things out with Ian, he and I sat down tonight to reflect on what we think has worked, what hasn&#8217;t, and set a clear plan for what we&#8217;ll do in the future. I&#8217;m really excited with what we came up with.

Starting next week, I&#8217;m confident that folks who have been listening to the experiment that has been the podcast will notice a huge shift (in a positive direction) in the feel and product. While we won&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s true until next week, this reflects the way that I try to approach most new projects: experiment a bunch, reflect, synthesize, retool, then focus in.

With my writing for <a href="http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com" target="_blank">It&#8217;s Pronounced Metrosexual</a>, I followed this approach. My first few things I posted were all over the place, and I had no idea what would resonate with people, and I didn&#8217;t really think too much about it. I just did a bunch of different things, really focusing on exploring the possibilities and less on doing what was &#8220;right&#8221; or &#8220;good.&#8221; After a couple months, I looked back at what was effective (shared the most, generated the most discussion, etc.) and for the past couple of years I&#8217;ve kept my focus on producing content based on those first few successful themes (e.g., the &#8220;privilege lists&#8221; on the site).

I like this approach. It works well for me. I&#8217;m going to try to do apply it to more parts of my life.
