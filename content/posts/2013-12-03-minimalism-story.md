In my shortest (most minimal!) episode yet, I share how I got into minimalism and the major perks.

The book I mentioned is &#8220;The Art of Being Minimalist: How to Stop Consuming and Start Living&#8221; by Everett Bogue.

And thanks to Rustik Jamz for the music. Check them out: @[rustik-jamz][1]
