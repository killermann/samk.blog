For the past several years I&#8217;ve been social justice comeding. And I&#8217;ve been going [H.A.M.][1] I&#8217;ve [made][2] [a][3] [bunch][4] [of][5] [different][6] [things][7]. [And][8] [more][9]. And I haven&#8217;t taken a day off.

Well, the time has come.

I&#8217;m the perfect combination of completely excited, completely exhausted, thrilled, depleted, optimistic, and completely-lost-hope-in-humanity-because-of-Buzzfeed for a change of pace. I need a refresher. A break. A time to breathe. A time away from this god-forsaken laptop (kidding, [I love my laptop][10]). But I am going to abandon it for a month.<!--more-->

And it&#8217;s coming in the form of a trip to [Africaaaaaaa][11]. I&#8217;ve [always wanted][12] to explore Egypt, can&#8217;t think of a better way to spend a good chunk of my summer (as well as the first vacation I&#8217;ve taken since I started this stage of my life), and am going for more reasons than I can/will recount here (but will find some time for later). It&#8217;ll be good. I need it.

As I explained on my &#8220;[official][13]&#8221; site, [I&#8217;m Heading to Cairo, and I wanna hang with some lovely people in Cairo][14]. A bunch have gotten in touch, and it warmed my heart, and I&#8217;m super-duper looking forward to coffeeing, and hummsing, and brunching with them &#8212; in that order. Yes, _brunching_. I&#8217;ll be in good hands.

If you&#8217;re curious to follow along on my adventures, I&#8217;ll be offering the occasional update by way of a couple super lovely and couldn&#8217;t-do-it-without-them friends/amazing people/mangers/coworkers/fellow Auntie Anne&#8217;s enthusiasts (just me?) Chum (mostly via [Facebook][15] and [Twitter][16]) and Bethany (mostly via this site and perhaps a little [IPM love][7]).

I&#8217;ll miss you. I&#8217;ll be back soon. And I&#8217;ll have so many stories to share.

Peace, Love, Egypt.
