I&#8217;ve never been a fan of New Year&#8217;s resolutions. I&#8217;ve generally had the perspective of Mr. Twain. But that&#8217;s because resolutions are so commonly things that won&#8217;t actually improve someone&#8217;s life, or (and especially) the lives of others in their life. But what if we all had the same New Year&#8217;s resolutions, and were able to hold one another mutually accountable, and they improved our lives _and_ the lives of those in our lives?

If a genie gave me just one wish&#8230; I would wish for infinite hummus. Sorry. But if I was lucky enough to stumble upon another genie, my wish would be for everyone to make these New Year&#8217;s Resolutions (ya know, in case treating [every day like Christmas][1] isn&#8217;t your style). I believe in the power of individuals, and we can change the world one person at a time for the better. But it starts with changing our individual worlds. So, Mark Twain be damned, **this year I resolve to:**

  1. **Realize that I&#8217;m incredibly fortunate.** Even when things seem like they can&#8217;t get worse, and I think the whole world is against me, the simple fact that I&#8217;m able to be unhappy is a byproduct of the fortune of being given that opportunity to be unhappy.
  2. **Be [grateful][2] for what I have.** I don&#8217;t have much, but I have plenty. Flipping a switch and having lights come on, for example, is pretty freaking awesome. I want to remind myself to be more thankful for those things, every day.
  3. **Want [less][3], and learn to want to give more.** Giving is happiness.
  4. **Understand that it&#8217;s okay not to be happy all the time.** And to affirm others in understanding this. Life has ups and downs and lefts and wrongs. It&#8217;s okay to not be happy &#8212; it just makes happy even better when I get it.
  5. **Appreciate aloneness.** To not freak out, to make the most of the peace, and to remember that [being alone isn&#8217;t the same as being lonely][4].
  6. **Love more and judge less.** _&#8220;This goes for loving yourself, too, Mister!&#8221; _I yell at myself, judgmentally, because I know that I&#8217;m far more likely to love and avoid judging another person. I can definitely do more loving of myself and others, and less judging of myself and others.
  7. **Eat less food that makes me feel like garbage.** Yeah, it tastes good in the moment, but I&#8217;d bet heroin feels pretty good, and you don&#8217;t see me eating that every weekend.
  8. **Move my body more.** Sitting is bad, and I do it too much. I don&#8217;t enjoy exercising, but I want to learn to enjoy it. When I nudge myself to do it, I almost always enjoy it. I&#8217;m going to do that more.
  9. **Put myself in unknown situations.** Comfort is good, but growth comes from challenge. I&#8217;m going to seek out unknown situations, read things I may not have otherwise read, talk to people I may have otherwise ignored.
 10. **Treat individual human beings as individual human beings.** Don&#8217;t allow myself to track my mud into their houses, or the mud that someone else who may have looked like/sounded like/smelled like them do the same.
 11. **Not let my pride stand between me and something or someone.** It doesn&#8217;t matter what the &#8220;principle&#8221; of the matter was, or all the other bullshit excuses I use. What matters is what I want to happen in the future, and whether I&#8217;m willing to circumvent pride to make it happen.
 12. **Sweep before my own door first.** To remember that I&#8217;m not helping any one &#8212; as a hard worker, friend, partner, etc. &#8212; if I&#8217;m not taking care of myself. I need to [be my own friend first][5].

_If you&#8217;re up for this challenge, [let me know][6]. Or share the list with a friend as a friendly challenge. We can be one another&#8217;s accountabilibuddies. Gosh, I love spelling that word._
