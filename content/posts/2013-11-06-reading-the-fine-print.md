Sometimes<sup>1</sup> we overlook what&#8217;s truly important<sup>2</sup>, and inadvertently focus far too much of our attention<sup>3</sup> on things that are inconsequential<sup>4</sup>. We&#8217;re tricked<sup>5</sup>, by ourselves<sup>6</sup>, and by influences in our life<sup>7</sup>, into being mislead without even realizing we&#8217;re being mislead<sup>8</sup>. It&#8217;s the most dangerous form of dishonesty<sup>9</sup>, because it exploits our inherent want to trust<sup>10</sup>, and turns our own good faith against us<sup>11</sup>, like a knife with a sharp handle and a dull blade<sup>12</sup>. I would never (and do not) suggest that we should not be trusting people<sup>13</sup>, but I would just warn that we should be critical consumers<sup>14</sup> of the truths we internalize<sup>15</sup>. If we became more inquisitive<sup>16</sup> and less certain, we&#8217;d be happier people<sup>17</sup>, and the world would be a happier place<sup>18</sup>.

 

 

<sup>1</sup>Most of the time
  
<sup>2</sup>Important™ is a registered trademark of the Coca-Cola® Corporation
  
<sup>3</sup>Slack-jawed, mind-numbed mouseclicking
  
<sup>4</sup>Miley Cyrus
  
<sup>5</sup>Tricked implies that there was an agreement set forth that would suggest a relationship other than the one set forth, but all parties heretofore have agreed to this relationship by not opting out, pending successful credit check.
  
<sup>6</sup>You™ are a registered trademark of the Coca-Cola® Corporation
  
<sup>7</sup>the Coca-Cola® Corporation
  
<sup>8</sup>Inception is a really deep movie that has layers of thought that are worth discussing over coffee it&#8217;s not just confusing nonsense spun around a great cast.
  
<sup>9</sup>Fox News is the Most Dangerous Form of Dishonesty®
  
<sup>10</sup>Hold me.
  
<sup>11</sup>Coca-Cola® Corporation is not responsible for good faith, turning things against other things, or providing non-toxic potable substances for consumption
  
<sup>12</sup>Patent-pending
  
<sup>13</sup>I will (and do) suggest that you should trust no one. Not even Claire, your high school love who signed your yearbook and told you that she&#8217;d love you forever.
  
<sup>14</sup>Especially Claire.
  
<sup>15</sup>CLAIRE I LOVED YOU WHY DID YOU RIP MY HEART OUT AND THROW IT IN A VITAMIX™ BLENDER?!
  
<sup>16</sup>Who, what, where?
  
<sup>17</sup>Like Will Smith, from _Fresh Prince of Bel Air_
  
<sup>18</sup>Like 7 Billion Will Smiths, from _Fresh Prince of Bel Air_
