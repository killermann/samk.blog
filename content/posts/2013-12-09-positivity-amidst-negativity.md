I got an email with the above title and the following snippets, from a wonderful person who&#8217;s struggling with something I struggle with every day.

> In following your blogs and talks, I&#8217;ve been impressed with the positivity and humor that you project. I would so love to hear how you keep that positivity when you know so much about all the really depressing facts of heterosexual privilege&#8230;Â Becoming more aware is a very good thing, but I also noted that when I see so much unfairness, my ability to view the world positively, which I always thought was quite reliable, came crashing down&#8230; What are some ways that you combat the depressing news and facts that are constantly floating around?

_Below is what I had to say in response. If you have a question like this, or any question really, that you&#8217;d be okay with me answering on this site, write me at yo [at] samkillermann [dawt] com. I&#8217;d love to hear from you._

What you&#8217;re experiencing isn&#8217;t just something I&#8217;ve struggled with before, but something I have to be mindful about every day. For me, being positive in the face of negativity isn&#8217;t just important for me personally, but a requirement for what I&#8217;m trying to do.

The analogy that best describes how I handle the negativity is that of a buoy. I allow myself to be pushed and pulled, and to feel the effects of the currents, but I always stay above the surface. If there&#8217;s a particularly bad swell (some absolutely miserable bit of news, or an email that rocks me) I may get dragged under, but I have a few things I do that help me shirk that burden and pop back up to the surface.

1. I try to tread in waters where I have the abilities to help. Everyone can&#8217;t help everyone all the time &#8212; they&#8217;d break. And there is a ton of injustice in the world that needs the help of a ton of people.

2. Similarly, I&#8217;ve learned to say no. &#8220;No&#8221; to a particular article or video, and especially no to news aggregators that churn out endless &#8220;this is wrong with the world&#8221; and no &#8220;this is how it&#8217;s being fixed.&#8221; I try to be selective in what I consume.

3. If something sneaks in (e.g., a video about child slavery, something I&#8217;m ill-equipped to help), I&#8217;ll do one of two things. If I have a friend/peer who is working in that arena of social justice, I&#8217;ll share it with them. And if not, I&#8217;ll watch it, allow it to make me mad/angry/sad/depressed, allow myself to feel those feelings, then get back to work. I try my hardest not to carry any burdens I shouldn&#8217;t be carrying.

4. In general, I try to be an intentionally grateful person. In every aspect of my life. I&#8217;m grateful when I wake up, when I have hot water to shower, when I have food to eat, or when I have the opportunity to get more food, etc. I also try to focus on the good that&#8217;s happening in the world, be grateful for that, and to find the good in even the worst news (e.g., I&#8217;m grateful these things are being discussed, as they may not have been 10 years ago, or under a different political system). It&#8217;s only when I&#8217;m dragged deep into the sea that I get to see all the beautiful fishes.

5. And when everything seems to be piling on, and I&#8217;m way too deep to see the daylight above, I step back. I turn everything off. Disconnect from the world and try to connect more with my world. Get out of the ocean and rest on the beach. For a day. For a week. Whatever I need. One time, it was longer. And when I&#8217;m ready I wade back in.

Let me know if you have any questions. Sorry for the delay; I had to dig your email out of my spam folder (silly, Gmail). Also, if you&#8217;d be okay with it, I think I&#8217;d like to publish this convo on my site (your part abridged, and anonymous). Others likely have the same concern and might benefit from it.

Never ask for permission to smile,
