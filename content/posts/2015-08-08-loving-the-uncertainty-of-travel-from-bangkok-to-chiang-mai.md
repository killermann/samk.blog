We pile our bags on a little side street in downtown Bangkok. It&#8217;s 8pm, the city&#8217;s lights are waking up, and busses fill the street. A double-decker bus drives by, inside on the top level a man is singing karaoke to the rest of the travelers. We&#8217;re waiting for bus #3, our nine-hour overnight ride to Chiang Mai, a rural town in northern Thailand.

We can&#8217;t find our bus.

Mike and I are sitting on the stoop of a closed shop, the dozen pieces of luggage and gear scattered around us. We are drinking a beer and appreciating the calamity of the moment: unsure of where we&#8217;ll be in the moments that come, what it will feel like, and how we will be getting there. It&#8217;s one of the best things about traveling &#8212; the constant uncertainty, the focus on the moment, the near-to-nothing being granted &#8212; if you can learn to appreciate it. Admittedly, it&#8217;s an acquired taste. It&#8217;s my coffee. It&#8217;s my wine.

After some confusion and stress, we learn our bus has already arrived. It&#8217;s been waiting for us.

We don&#8217;t know what to expect inside. The conditions of the bus, the seats, the air, the noise. We&#8217;re hoping to sleep, but first we&#8217;re hoping the seat recline functions. I can&#8217;t help but think back to the bus I rode from Cairo into the middle of the White Desert (the half-day of one-hundred degree sun, the broken air conditioning, the overcramped seating, the failing engine).

We pile into the bus and find that we have a private room in the front half of the lower level. Eight seats all to ourselves. I wouldn&#8217;t have hoped for anything better. The seats recline. It does get better. And there&#8217;s air conditioning. I could die happy on this bus.

The bus jerks into gear. A strange smell sweeps through our cabin. _We might die on this bus._

Most of the crew is asleep within the hour. We rumble our way out of Bangkok onto a highway, and outside of the occasional jolt and shake, the ride is uneventful. My face and chest are cold, but my seat and legs are sweating. It&#8217;s a confusing sensation, and for a moment I&#8217;m worried I&#8217;ve caught a travel bug from the water. _I keep eating the goddamn ice_, I think-yell to myself. _I need to stop eating the goddamn ice._ I ask around, I&#8217;m not the only straddling the two temperatures. The air conditioning is blasting from above, while a large gap in the bottom of the door lets hot air flood in around our feet. It&#8217;s the bus, not a bug. _I&#8217;m gonna keep eating the goddamn ice_, I think as I nod off.

I wake up as we pull into a travel plaza for a break. It&#8217;s a few hundred meters long, all open air, and has nearly every snack and food item I&#8217;ve seen in Thailand, all packed into a truck stop. There&#8217;s a large fishtank that has four sad fish swimming around. A bank of 80 urinals serving as the &#8220;men&#8217;s room,&#8221; also in the open air. We have a few minutes to stretch our legs, refresh, then we&#8217;re back on the bus for the second half of the haul.

I reblanket my face. _Sorry, legs, it&#8217;s time to sweat._

The bus comes to a halt a few hours later. It&#8217;s 6am and we&#8217;re in Chiang Mai. It&#8217;s another sunny, beautiful morning. The streets are empty but for the new travelers and a few motorbikes. We can&#8217;t get into our room until afternoon. Time to find a place where we can bunker down until then. Time to explore.
