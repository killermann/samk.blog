I blogged my newest book! Below you can find all the entries I wrote in January as progress toward a book about problematic activism and social justice dogma.

P.S. I don't know the title yet, so I'm just calling it "The Social Justice, Minus Dogma [SJMD] Book" for now, following in the vein of the course and podcast and other resources I've created that led to this book.
