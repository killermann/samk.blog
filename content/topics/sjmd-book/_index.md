I'm blogging my newest book! I created [a special mailing list for everyone who wants to follow along and participate](https://hues.ck.page/353dcc23a0). You can also just come back to this page periodically, or subscribe [via RSS]((index.xml)).

P.S. I don't know the title yet, so I'm just calling it "The SJMD Book" for now, following in the vein of the course and podcast and other resources I've created that led to this book.
