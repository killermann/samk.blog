Let's say you're going out to dinner with some friends. Everyone is tossing out ideas for where to go, and you suggest that new taco food truck that just opened up.

One of your friends replies, "I don't think that'll work. Are you sure they're open? I'm pretty sure they're closed today."

How do you react? 

Let me venture a few guesses for how you _don't_ react. I'd be willing to bet all the tacos in Austin (i.e., give up roughly 1/3 of my nutritional sustenance) that you don't say:

1. "I guess you don't want to go to dinner after all!" _or_
2. "So... you hate tacos?" _or_
3. "You don't get to weigh in on whether or not we have tacos -- you're white." _or_
4. "Lol you believe they're closed? You've clearly been brainwashed by the burger chain."

Hopefully, those three reactions are sufficiently ridiculous that you can't imagine yourself -- or any other person who has at least one _frijole_ of emotional intelligence -- saying any of them.

Now, if any one of those three _is_ how you'd typically respond in that situation, the rest of this is going to be really frustrating for you. Be warned. (I'm also sorry for everyone in your life.)

Just so we're all on the same page, before I start connecting dots between taco trucks and Social Justice Dogma (SJD) -- betcha you saw that coming -- I'm going to briefly explain what is ridiculous about each of those replies.

**The first reaction** is mistaking pushback to a particular idea within a larger plan, as pushback to the plan itself. You'd be saying, "If you aren't 100% supportive of every aspect of this, you must be 0% supportive of it."

**The second reaction** is making a big leap and insinuating an intention for _why_ they expressed any pushback at all, and manufacturing it out of thin air. It's saying, "I know you didn't say anything remotely similar to this, but you must be thinking this if you feel that way."

**The third reaction** is good ol' fashioned race reductionism with a side of dismissal. It's saying, "Because of this immutable characterstic you possess or embody, your opinion is invalid."

**And the fourth reaction** (my personal fav, for those keeping track) travels back into imagination land, but instead of merely assume-creating an intention, we are tracking _the source of their intentions_ to misinformation from some biased third-party. It's saying, "You don't even know what you think, but I do, _and_ it's wrong."

Okay, so what's any of this have to do with SJD?

Well, what we'd all agree are inappropriate responses to taco truck pushback are totally appropriate responses to social justice pushback. And not only appropriate, but encouraged! In fact, depending on your setting or who you're surrounded by, you might be looking at the only three options you're _allowed_ by SJD.

I'm going to explain what I mean by "allowed," and I'll also walk through how each one of those examples is paralleled in social justice conversations, but first I want to clarify what I mean by "social justice pushback."

## What's "Social Justice Pushback"?

When I say "social justice pushback" I'm using it as a shorthand way of describing:

- Pushing back (i.e. disagreeing with, reacting negatively, or not responding in the affirmative) against a social justice idea, strategy, tactic, belief, etc.

To be clear, I don't mean pushback _in the name of_ social justice (e.g., disrupting an oppressive system). I mean pushing back against something done _in the name of_ social justice. (But -- and I'll get to this later -- I don't think there's as much of a distinction there as you might be noticing.)

The ways social justice pushback shows up are countless. Here are some examples I see a lot:

- Disagreeing with a statistic (or citing a different stat, from a different source)
- Saying that a tactic, plan, or strategy might not work, or that a better one exists
- Asking "Why?" questions about a theory or other social justice concept, trying to get to the bottom of it, or what's behind it
- Requesting that someone explain where their information is coming from
- Pushing for nuance when someone frames something in absolute terms

I trust that's enough examples to give you a decent boundary for what I mean here, but I'll go one step further. Here's what I _don't_ consider social justice pushback: 

- Dismissing social justice as a desirable goal for society or the world
- Arguing in favor of some oppressive system, or for continued subordination of certain people

_Push_-back, not *shove*-back. Or _set-fire-to_-back.

## How We Respond to Social Justice Pushback

Let's get back to those examples from earlier. 

I rank-ordered them not just in "response to the taco truck is closed" ridiculousness, but also based on the frequency with which I notice each one being deployed in social justice spaces, where #1 is by far the most common. 

Let's start there. I'll be moving away from the taco truck language and giving you some examples of actual social justice responses to pushback.

### 1. "I guess you don't care about social justice."

This sentiment gets expressed a lot when people pushback against anything social justice, question an idea, or even hint at a lack of 100% blind faith support.

Feel free to swap "don't care about" with different flavors of opposition (e.g., "aren't in favor of," "don't believe in"), but the important distinction here I want to highlight is that we're interpreting pushback to an aspect of social justice as pushback to social justice itself. 

With that in mind, you can also swap out "social justice" for other liberation movements or activism goals (e.g., "feminism," "environmentalism," "racial justice").

**The move here is to say that if you don't like this one part of the thing, you must not like the thing.** 

It's moving the conversation a level up, like saying, "You don't like pepperoni? I guess you don't like pizza."

### 2. "So you hate trans people?"

Like with the first example, the verb is here interchangeable from "hate" to lots of different negatively-valenced actions (from more extreme examples like "want to murder" to more mellow ones like "don't validate"). 

And the target of accused hatred can be swapped for other groups of people (e.g., "people of color", "muslims", "poor people"), social justice ideas or goals (e.g., "reparations"), or other entities held in high regard in social justice spaces.

**The move here is imbuing the person who is expressing pushback with an intense animus about something connected to whatever they were pushing back against.**

They aren't just unsure about that idea, or misunderstanding that theory: they are intentionally and maliciously trying to hurt the people implicated by it.

It's saying, "You don't like pizza? I guess you hate Italians."

### 3. "You don't get an opinion. You're a man."

As per the examples above, you can sub out "man" for other dominant group membership or majoritized identities (e.g., "White," "cisgender," "middle/upper class," "straight").

And sometimes the first part is about not getting a say or being allowed a voice, while other times it's more about the incorrect-ness of the person's opinion because of who they are.

In all cases, the only way this reaction passes muster is because of the [social justice power inverse](https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2019/03/the-social-justice-power-inverse/). If those rules aren't followed (e.g., the identity being dismissed is minoritized or a target group membership), this will read as some Daily Stormer bullshit and be thrown out immediately (e.g., SJD doesn't permit a "You don't get an opinion on this. You're black." response to pushback).

This reaction is saying, "Of course you don't like pizza -- you're Christian."

### 4. "You disagree? White Supremacy is a helluva drug."

This reaction is basically saying "your social justice pushback is invalid because its rooted in[unconscious] bias."

Here, you can sub "White Supremacy" for any other oppressive system of dominance, or unconscious bias (e.g., "ethnocentrism," "cisnormativity," "patriarchy").
