Over the years that I've been working on the internet, I haven't encountered this.

Don't get me wrong: I've created lots of duds. I've made things people don't care about. And I've written, published, and created things that were either before their time, after, or maybe there never would be a "their time." So I've seen my share of making unpopular stuff.

But this isn't that.

I've also created lots of firecrackers. Resources, essays, websites, and more that took off instantly, going truly viral, reaching tens of thousands of people in a few days, and over a million in a few weeks -- all without any financial backing, advertising, or support. Just word of mouth.

And this has certainly not been that.

This is different from either of those outcomes. It's in some third, hard-to-name bucket. It's weird. 

Here are a few of the things I've noticed as I've been trying to create conversations about "social justice dogma" for the past couple of years:

1. I've gotten more emails about SJD than any other topic I write about. Not just more per article, where more people reply to the emails when I publish a new one. More period. In the past year, more people have written in to reply to my SJD stuff, or give me ideas, or thank me for working on that project, than anything else I've created.
