For 14 days now I've been writing daily [essays](/essays/) about dogmatic activism for my ["Social Justice, Minus Dogma Book"](/topics/sjmd-book) (I don't know what it'll be called in the end, but that's what I'm calling it now)

When I started that series, I assumed that anyone who [followed along on the mailing list](https://bit.ly/sjmdbook) would've already been familiar with my other writing on social justice dogma (SJD). I was wrong! It's been fun to hear from so many people for whom this was their first touch with either SJD, or even my writing.

So, with all of you in mind, as well as anyone else who is just getting started learning about SJD, I put together the following collection. 

I've arranged all of these articles based on the order I'd recommend, not based on when they were written. You are, of course, welcome to pick and choose, or read in whatever order sparks your fancy. 

First, let's start with a definition for social justice dogma. What are we even talking about here?

## Definition

> **The Social Justice Dogma (SJD)** is the set of beliefs, stances, and acceptable actions laid down by the authorities within the social justice movement that we hold as incontrovertibly true.

The **beliefs** show up as accepted facts, truths, and principles that we learn as we become part of the social justice movement, and work to teach others.

**Stances** show up most strongly as things, ideas, or people that we are -- or _should be_ -- against. They also show up as things we should be for.

**Acceptable actions** are the tactics we should use to put our beliefs and stances to work -- all the ways we're supposed to show up, interact with others (both inside and outside of the movement), and advance the cause.

The **authorities** part is the trickiest, because within the movement we have a lot of different authorities, but you can think of authorities generally as anyone, or any source (platform, org, publication, etc.), who is writing the rules above that we follow, and enforce amongst ourselves. Authorities are the "they" when someone says, "_They_ said you shouldn't say/think/do that." Authorities as sources show up when people say "I read on [source] that we should now say/think/do this."
