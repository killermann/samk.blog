If I was teaching a masterclass in [social justice dogma](/what-is-social-justice-dogma/#definition) (SJD), this would be the take home lesson: in the right hands, the concepts of unconscious bias and internalized oppression can be used to shut down any dissent.

Like a pair of magical boxing gloves, if you put these beauties on and swing, nobody will be left standing.

It doesn't matter who you're talking to. They can be a dominant group member talking about oppression that doesn't target them, or a person who holds a dozen intersecting marginalized identities speaking from their own experience.

And beyond _who_ you're talking to, it doesn't matter what they're saying. 

They could be giving you a first-hand account of their truth on the matter, or recounting other people's perspectives. Their argument could be well-substantiated by a wide read of literature, research, and other supporting theory. They could even have a degree in the social-justice-centered subject you're talking about.

None of that matters. 

If someone is saying something that you disagree with, think is problematic, doesn't align with your view of what's important or helpful for social justice, or -- even better -- they're trying to undermine an argument _you're_ making, all you need to do is hit them with a quick one-two:

1. **Unconscious Bias:** "You're being motivated by oppression that you aren't aware of. Because of how systemically oppression is ingrained in our day-to-day lives, we often don't realize that a viewpoint, argument, belief, or stance that we think is neutral, is actually rooted in oppression."
2. **Internalized Oppression:** "Just because you hold a targeted identity doesn't mean you're not supporting oppression. A lot of people internalize the oppression they've been taught about themselves, and then perpetuate that oppression by reinforcing it for other people, or obstructing progress toward justice."

This combo comes in handy when:

- [Reacing to social justice pushback](/reacting-to-social-justice-pushback/): any time someone is disagreeing with a tactic, strategy, or fact that you're advocating for
- [Someone questions the veracity of your Vox Populi or Sockpuppet reporting](/sockpuppets-vox-populi/): use this combo to defend yourself whenever you're saying that something is true for an entire group of people, or that a certain marginalized population believes a certain thing, and someone says otherwise

And more!

You can even use this combo proactively. 

Before you've received pushback, or had your position criticized, you can preemptively debunk anyone who _might_ say otherwise by including a notice about unconscious bias (to discourage anyone from disagreeing, lest they accidentally act on something they didn't know they believed) or internalized oppression (for anyone holding the identity or targeted by the -ism in question).

And don't take it from me: I'm not the originator of this undefeatable martial art, it's just something I've learned from watching the masters. 

I'm young Daniel, and other social justice people within the movement are Mr. Miyagi. They had me over here waxing cars and painting fences, learning about oppression and bias. I didn't realize I was surreptitiously being taught a technique of impenetrable defense and and piercing attack. SJD meets Karate.

Want to see it in action? Go to a social justice workshop or training, scroll your social media newsfeeds, or hop onto a popular social justice or intersectional feminism website, magazine, or blog. It's not hard to find someone busting these moves out if you know what you're looking for.

One note: they only work if you're doing them _in the name of_ social justice. You can't dismiss someone with "unconscious bias" from a conservative position, if they're advancing a socially-just one; and "internalized oppression" only works as a way of shutting down pushback if you're working against oppression yourself, or at least that's your intention. 

This is because the power of these moves is derived from the [Cornerstones of SJD](/cornerstones-of-social-justice-dogma/), and they only exist in Social Justice Land.

Related note: does this mean that this move is susceptible to an ["Enemy of Your Enemy"-type](/enemy-of-your-enemy/) counter-attack, where anti-social-justice people deploy the combo against social justice people, masquerading as activists and exploiting SJD? Yes, yes it does, and I've seen that happen in workshops and online, and it results in, to say the least, a fiasco.

More questions and answers about the two-punch combo:

Are the concepts of unconscious bias and internalized oppression insightful, useful, and helpful in us moving toward living social justice? 

Absolutely!

Is this a bad faith way to engage in conversations about important, complicated, life-or-death issues? 

It sure is!

Might deploying these concepts in this way taint their usefulness, make it harder to discuss them in good faith ways, and end up getting in the way, in the long run toward living social justice?

I hope not, because that ship might have already sailed.
